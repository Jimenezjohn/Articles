 don’t require the addition of ARIA attributes to expose the semantics 
they have, as, for the most part, browsers expose this information: <strong>YAY.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>This is expressed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#implicit_semantics">ARIA specification</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>…there are many situations in which <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics are redundant with host language semantics.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is also expressed in HTML as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance">a set of rules</a> to dissuade developers from unecessarily adding ARIA attributes, acting under the falsehood that it is somehow beneficial.</p>

<blockquote><p>Setting an <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr><code>role</code> and/or <code>aria-*</code> attribute that matches the default implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> semantics is unnecessary and is <em title="NOT RECOMMENDED">not recommended</em> as these properties are already set by the browser.</p>
<p>Default Implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA </abbr>semantics – <em title="SHOULD NOT">should not </em>be used</p></blockquote>
<p>This why developers who do so and <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">check their HTML conformance</a> with the HTML standard will get warnings like this:</p>
<p><img src="A%20(not%20so)%20short%20note%20on%20ARIA%20to%20the%20rescue_files/Capture.png" alt="Warning! The heading role is unnecessary for element h1." moz-reader-center="true" width="734" height="140"></p>
<p>And this is a <strong>good thing</strong>. Although in most circumstances the presence of ARIA semantics that duplicates <em>default implicit semantics</em> will not have a detrimental effect, addition of unecessary attributes leads to extra work, code bloat, and can lead to errors.</p>
<h2>SHOULD NOT, because sometimes…</h2>
<p>We have a client, who has set on an environment for particular 
reasons, that uses a locked down version of Chrome and allows only JAWS 
as a screen reader.</p>
<p>JAWS does not officially support Chrome and while Chrome does a <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/">good job</a>
 at exposing the correct information for Assistive Technology (AT), 
sometimes the AT falls short in making use of the information or does 
not interpret the information correctly.</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue may be a regression in a new version of the 
software and will hopefully be fixed in the next version. Other times 
it’s a long standing bug in the browser or AT. As accessibility 
practioners/engineers/developers (call yourself what you will), we have 
to take a view on whether to advise the client to implement a work 
around or code the workaround ourselves, or whether users can take a 
hit, as it’s a temporary problem and not a show stopper for users.</p>
<p>In the case above the issue was that JAWS in combination with Chrome 
(as of version &lt;=51) does not correctly identify heading (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#the-h1-h2-h3-h4-h5-and-h6-elements">H1-h6</a>)
 levels, so content structure/hierarchy is not conveyed. The problem 
here is with JAWS, Chrome exposes&nbsp;headings correctly in the <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/the-browser-accessibility-tree/">accessibility tree</a>. i.e. a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> has a <code>role=heading</code> and a <code>level=1</code>, a <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> has a <code>role=heading</code> and a <code>level=3</code>, but JAWS reports all headings (<code>h1-h6</code>) as “heading level 2” doh!</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the environement is a set version of chrome 
(51) and a set version of JAWS (17) so me thinks this is not an issue 
that will go away soon, and users of this system will be at a 
disadvantage because of this. The initial advice was to <em>at least</em> provide some information up front to JAWS users, so they were aware of the issue. Then I thought I would try adding the <code>aria-level</code> attribute to the headings with a value that matches the default level of the heading:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;<span>h1</span> <span>aria-level</span>=<span>"1"</span>&gt;</span>...
<span>&lt;<span>h2</span>&gt;</span>...
<span>&lt;<span>h3</span> <span>aria-level</span>=<span>"3"</span>&gt;</span>...
</pre>
<p>I wasn’t super optimistic about this having an effect, as I know that
 the attributes through which ARIA can be used to manipulate the browser
 accessibility tree properties are exposed via the platform 
accessibility API properties/values (where they exist) rather than any 
ARIA magic, and both <code>level</code> and <code>role=heading</code> are standard across accessibility APIs. To my surprise use of <code>aria-level</code> worked, you can try it yourself in chrome/JAWS:</p>


<p>That it worked told me that JAWS is likely doing some DOM hacking and picking up the <code>aria-level </code>
 attribute rather than reading the correct value already conveyed by 
chrome through the Accessibility Tree. Point is it worked and the client
 can be advised on a simple workaround to support the correct semantics 
for users.</p>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>This is a tale of a particular circumstance where going against the 
general rule of ARIA not being required to expose native HTML semantics,
 was of benefit.&nbsp; It is in <strong>no way</strong> meant to suggest that adding <code>aria-level</code> to <code>h1-h6</code> is required or recommended in general. It is a bug in JAWS that needs to be fixed.</p>
