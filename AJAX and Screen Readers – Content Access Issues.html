						<p>The rise in the use of <abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr>
 to dynamically change content without refreshing the page has resulted 
in accessibility problems for users of Assistive Technology such as 
Screen Readers. The problem can be divided into two issues<span id="more-2470"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Users not having access to content changes.</li>
<li>Users not being aware of the changed content <em>if they can</em> access it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first issue, which is detailed in this article, is largely 
confined to 2 software products, the JAWS and Window Eyes Screen 
Readers. The second issue potentially affects users of most Assistive 
Technology including Screen Readers and Screen Magnifiers.</p>
<h3>Access to updated or new content</h3>
<p>JAWS and Window Eyes are the 2 most popular screen readers on the 
Windows operating system. They both provide access to web pages by 
taking a copy of the <abbr title="document object model"></abbr>DOM of 
the page displayed in the web browser and storing it in a “virtual 
buffer”. It is this copy that the user interacts with when browsing 
(known as “browse mode”), unless they are interacting with some types of
 form controls in which case they interact directly with the browser 
(known as “forms mode”).</p>
<h4>Browse mode</h4>
<p>When in browse mode the user can navigate to or list many components 
of page structure including headings, controls, paragraphs and links 
using keystrokes. One major limitation of browse mode for users of JAWS 
prior to version 7.1 and all Window Eyes versions is, that unless they 
do something such as press a button, their view of the content is 
static. If an independent content update occurs in the browser view of 
the page it is not automatically updated in the AT users view. Also user
 dependent changes are not reliably updated, especially when AJAX is 
used, due to the latency issue. Another limitation is that the user 
cannot interact with some types of form controls.</p>
<h4>Forms mode</h4>
<p>To use a text <code>input</code>, <code>textarea</code> or <code>select</code>
 element the user must step out of browse mode into forms mode. When in 
forms mode only content contained in elements that can receive focus or 
content associated with controls (implicit – content positioned near a 
control or explicit – label element or title attribute) is <em>practically</em>
 available to the user. Compared to browse mode, the user’s ability to 
navigate and access non interactive content is severely restricted.</p>
<h3>Triggering and Update – JAWS prior to version 7.1 and all Window Eyes versions</h3>
<p>An update of the screen reader view is never triggered by a change in
 content in the browser view, only by a user action, either knowingly or
 unknowingly. For the users view of the content to be updated and 
synchronised with the browser view, the user must either manually 
refresh (Window Eyes ctr+shift+A twice, JAWS insert+esc) the screen 
readers copy of the page or press the enter or spacebar keys, actions 
which occur when a user activates a link, button or an element with an 
onclick event attached.</p>
<h4>enter and spacebar</h4>
<p>The developers at GWMicro (Window Eyes) and Freedom Scientific (JAWS)
 both implemented a similar substandard fix to the issue of updating the
 virtual copy in response to JavaScript based changes in browser 
content. They figured that if they attached a virtual buffer update 
command in response to the pressing of the enter or spacebar keys, any 
content change <em>that may</em> occur, if by chance the element 
triggered a JavaScript based content change would be included in the new
 copy, and thus be available to the user.</p>
<p>On the surface this may have seem like a reasonable solution, but it 
has a number of major flaws; the most glaring being that the user must 
do something in order for the content to be updated, secondly the 
JavaScript content change process must be completed within 400 – 1000 
milliseconds (the average time it takes for the virtual copy update to 
occur after it is triggered, this varies across screen readers, browsers
 and browser versions) of the user pressing the enter or spacebar key. 
If it is not completed within this time frame the updated content will 
not be included within the updated screen reader view. For most 
JavaScript routines the time frame is adequate and the change is caught 
by the copy update, but when AJAX is used for content updates it can 
regularly take longer than 400 milliseconds to complete. This <strong>latency</strong> leads to a disconnect between content the user has access to and what is displayed in the browser.</p>
<h4>Browser and screen reader view disconnect – independent content change</h4>
<p>An example of the occurence of a disconnect between the browser and screen reader view due to a change in content <strong>independent of user action</strong> is demonstrated in the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/removelink.html">independent content change</a>
 test page. In this example the page loads, after 5 seconds a script is 
called that removes 1 of the 3 links and 1of the 2 buttons on the page.</p>
<p>Users of JAWS &lt; 7.1 and Window Eyes will be presented with the 
initial content displayed on page load. they will not be informed that a
 change in content has occurred in the browser and will be able to 
browse through the original content, although it has changed in the 
browser.</p>
<p>If the JAWS user attempts to follow a link the result will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>the ‘Google’ link will load the Yahoo page</li>
<li>the ‘Yahoo’ link will load the article page</li>
<li>the ‘back to article’ link will update the screen reader view so it 
corresponds with the browser view, but the link will not be followed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Yes and No buttons:</p>
<ol>
<li>pressing the ‘yes’ button will press the no button</li>
<li>pressing the ‘no’ button will update the screen reader view so it 
corresponds with the browser view, but the action associated with the 
button is not triggered.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Window Eyes user, if they try to activate a link or button 
that no longer exists in the browser, the screen reader view is updated 
and the browser/screen reader views are synchronized.</p>
<h4>Browser and screen reader view disconnect (the latency issue) – user dependent content change</h4>
<p>An example of the occurance of a disconnect between the browser and screen reader view due to a change in content <strong>dependent on user action</strong> is demonstrated in the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/latencynobuf/index1.php">dependent content</a>
 test page. In this example when the 200 (millisecond) button is pressed
 a request is sent to the server using AJAX and a response is returned 
that changes the <code>alt </code>attribute content of the image to “200 milliseconds” and add the text “200 milliseconds” to an empty paragraph.</p>
<p>Users of JAWS &lt; 7.1 and Window Eyes will be able to access the 
changed content in the screen reader view as the time taken for the 
change to occur (200 milliseconds approximately) is within the 
acceptable latency period between action and content change. It is 
caught by the buffer update.</p>
<p>When the 1000 (millisecond) button is pressed the same process 
occurs, but the latency period is 1000 milliseconds (approximately). In 
this case the buffer update has already occured by the time the content 
change occurs. As a consequence JAW &lt; 7.1 and Window Eyes users will 
not have access to the changed content in the screen reader view. So for
 example, if the user has previously pressed the 200 button, they will 
still “see” the image <code>alt</code> and text as “200 milliseconds” although the content has changed (to “1000 milliseconds”) in the browser view.</p>
<h3>JAWS version 7.1 + and content change</h3>
<p>With the release of JAWS 7.1 there was a marked change in the way 
content changes are handled. The virtual buffer update is no longer tied
 to a user action (pressing the enter or spacebar keys), but updates in 
response to content change events in the browser. So, for example, if 
text is added or removed , it triggers a buffer update. This is a major 
improvement in relation to both user dependent and independent 
JavaScript based content changes. The latency issue (particularly in 
relation to <abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr>) 
is no longer a problem and the user does not have to do anything for the
 content change to be updated in the screen reader view. The examples of
 user <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/latencynobuf/index1.php">dependent</a> and <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/removelink.html">independent</a> content change do not cause a disconnect between browser and screen reader view.</p>
<p>There are still some issues which Gez Lemon and I detailed in <a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/improving-ajax-applications-for-jaws-users.php">Improving Ajax applications for JAWS users</a>, but with subsequent releases (current JAWS release is version 9), the support has improved.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The use of AJAX based content changes is still a formidable 
accessibility barrier for users of JAWS and Window Eyes, although the 
technical accessibility issue of access to content changes has been 
largely resolved in later versions of JAWS, Window Eyes has yet to 
tackle the problem. It is interesting to note that <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=23">NVDA</a>, a free screen reader, has better support for content updates than Window Eyes.</p>
<p>Furthermore the issue of informing users of content change has not 
been resolved. There are work arounds such as the use of the JavaScript <code>focus()</code>
 method to move focus to changed content, but this is not reliable and 
of use only in limited circumstances. The implementation of support for <a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/wai-aria-live-regions.php"><abbr title="web accessibility initiative">WAI</abbr> <abbr title="accessible rich internet applications">ARIA</abbr> live regions</a> by Assistive Technology vendors is required to provide developers with the tools required to resolve the <abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr> accessibility issue.</p>
