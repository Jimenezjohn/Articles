 are many ways to communicate about accessible web development 
practices; mailing lists, forums, IRC, articles, twitter, slack and 
gitter etc. Each has it’s pros and cons. I have been frequenting an <a href="https://web-a11y.slack.com/">A11y Slack</a> (<a href="http://web-a11y.herokuapp.com/">get an invite</a>)
 of late. I have found it a good place to mix it up with accessibility 
folk and web developers. But Slack has issues for users; its UI is not 
accessible and while it can also be used via IRC, the output of IRC has <a href="http://w3c.github.io/a11ySlackers/archives/160715.html#ircissue">proven problematic</a>.
 Also an issue with access to chat history arose, which has graciously 
been sorted by SlackHQ. I also find it a problem that while anyone can 
join, the content of the slack can only been viewed after sign in.</p>

<h3>Giving Gitter a Go</h3>
<p>Mike[tm]Smith suggested Gitter as an alternative:</p>
<blockquote lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner">@stevefaulkner</a> Time to switch to <a href="https://twitter.com/gitchat">@gitchat</a>（actually shoulda began there instead but not too late to fix the mistake…) <a href="https://t.co/jQ5TrnYTKn">https://t.co/jQ5TrnYTKn</a></p>
<p>— Michael[tm] Smith (@sideshowbarker) <a href="https://twitter.com/sideshowbarker/status/621126427795042304">July 15, 2015</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So I thought i would give it a go, hence <a href="https://gitter.im/w3c/a11ySlackers">A11ySlackers</a> was born. Some immediate advantages I found; It’s publicly viewable without sign in. The <a href="https://gitter.im/w3c/a11ySlackers/archives/all">archives are public</a>, it integrates with <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>,
 so if you have a github account you can sign in with it to chat. While 
the web UI sucks accessibility wise to a similar extent that Slack does,
 the IRC bridge is more practically usable for people who find the Web 
UI problematic. I have found it easy to scrape (manually at this stage) 
the public archives to create a <a href="http://w3c.github.io/a11ySlackers/archives/index.html">permanent record of discussions</a> in a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/a11ySlackers/tree/gh-pages">W3C repo</a>:</p>

<p>I have begun <a href="https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues">filing bugs</a> about Gitters web UI accessibility and suggest other people do the same. The newly formed <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">W3C Web Incubator Community Group</a> is <a href="https://gitter.im/WICG/admin">making use</a> of Gitter, so I for one have a vested interest in helping make Gitter more usable and accessible.</p>
<h3>Great, what is it?</h3>
<blockquote><p>A channel for anyone and everyone to discuss accessible web development</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What it is not:</strong> an official channel of the W3C <em>or</em> of any organisation.</p>
<p>So drop in and say <em>Hi</em> or lurk, ask a question or answer a 
question, share info, help make the web more accessible and usable for 
all. It’s not exclusive, no question is too simple, only rule is: be 
nice.</p>

<h3 id="sameroom">Breaking Down Silos with Sameroom</h3>
<p>An issue with having venues for discussion on mulitple platforms is 
that unless people are tuned into multiple places valuable opportunities
 for knowledge transfer can be lost. We are currently experimenting with
 <a href="https://sameroom.io/">Sameroom</a>, a service which allows us to have the <em>best of both worlds</em>
 (use of Gitter and Slack) as venues for people to discuss accessible 
web development. Using Sameroom the web-a11y Slack room and the 
A11ySlackers Gitter room have been joined, so discussion can be carried 
out between rooms using the service of your choice. It has overcome the 
issues with Slack IRC bridge (users can log into Gitter IRC and chat 
with people in slack and gitter) and also we get the benefits of the 
more public nature of the Gitter service.</p>
