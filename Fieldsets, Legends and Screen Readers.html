<p>The grouping and labelling of thematically related controls within a 
form is an important aspect of providing semantic information so users 
can understand and complete a form successfully. Differences in quality 
and implementation of support across user agents can hamper some users’ 
ability to benefit from this information. This must not be taken as 
disincentive to developers, as the benefits of using these elements 
outweighs the negatives. But it is clear that some assistive technology 
vendors need to improve implementation of HTML features that enhance 
accessibility, so their users can gain the most benefit.</p>
<h3>Using the fieldset and legend elements</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.10">HTML 4.1 specification</a> provides a method for grouping and labeling related form controls. This capability is provided by the use of the <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> elements:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.10"><p>The <code>fieldset</code> element allows authors to group thematically related controls and labels. <strong>Grouping controls makes it easier for users to understand their purpose</strong>
 while simultaneously facilitating tabbing navigation for visual user 
agents and speech navigation for speech-oriented user agents. The proper
 use of this element makes documents more accessible.</p>
<p>The <code>legend</code> element allows authors to assign a caption to a <code>fieldset</code>. <strong>The legend improves accessibility when the <code>fieldset</code> is rendered non-visually</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever a label is needed to provide information about a related set of controls consider using the <code>legend</code> and <code>fieldset</code>
 elements. They can be used to group any thematically related controls 
in a form such as address details, date of birth and sets of radio 
buttons or check boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is required that the <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> are used in conjunction. A <code>fieldset</code> cannot be used without a <code>legend</code> and visa versa.</p>
<h4>Example code:</h4>
<p><code><strong>&lt;fieldset&gt;</strong><br>
<strong>&lt;legend&gt;</strong>filter by<strong>&lt;/legend&gt;</strong><br>
&lt;input type="radio" name="filter" id="a"&gt;<br>
&lt;label for="a"&gt;television&lt;/label&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="radio" name="filter" id="b"&gt;<br>
&lt;label for="b"&gt;radio&lt;/label&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="radio" name="filter" id="c"&gt;<br>
&lt;label for="c"&gt;cinema&lt;/label&gt;<br>
<strong>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</strong></code></p>
<h3>Presentation to users</h3>
<h4>Visual browsers</h4>
<p>The default rendering of the <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> elements is fairly uniform across the major visual browsers. The <code>fieldset</code> is displayed with a solid border and the <code>legend</code>
 text is overlaid on the top left border. This provides a clear visual 
indication of the controls that are contained within the group and the 
caption (legend) that applies to the grouped controls.</p>
<h5>Default visual display in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera</h5>

<h4>Screen Readers</h4>
<p>For visual users, the association can be represented by the position 
of the legend and the enclosing of related controls within a bordered 
box. How should non visual user agents such as screen readers convey the
 structural associations provided by the legend and fieldset elements? 
The most important relationship is that of the <code>legend</code> text 
to the individual controls contained in a fieldset, as the legend serves
 to describe the context of the data or choices required. As the content
 is accessed linearly by screen readers, the apparent simple visual 
association is not so easily or clearly expressed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10-TECHS/topics.html#form-techniques">UAAG 1.0</a> (User Agent Accessibility Guidelines) provide this advice on implementation:</p>
<blockquote><p>HTML 4 specifies the FIELDSET element , which allows 
authors to group thematically related elements and labels. The LEGEND 
element assigns a caption to a <code>FIELDSET</code>. For example, the <code>LEGEND</code> element might identify a <code>FIELDSET</code>
 of radio buttons as “Connection Rate.” Each button could have a LABEL 
element, stating a rate. When it receives content focus, identify the 
radio button as “Connection Rate: Radio button X of Y: 28.8kpbs”, where 
“Y” represents the total number of radio buttons in the grouping and 
“28.8kbps” is the information contained in the <code>LABEL</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>With this implementation advice in mind, 2 of the major screen readers were tested using an example <code>fieldset</code> containing 3 radio buttons labelled “television, radio, cinema” with a <code>legend</code> of “filter by”. It was found that what is announced varies depending on the software, mode and navigation keys used.</p>
<h5>JAWS</h5>
<p>In Virtual PC cursor and Forms mode the <code>legend</code> is announced when each of the controls contained in a <code>fieldset </code>receive focus.</p>
<h6>virtual PC cursor ‘browse’ mode</h6>
<p>If the user moves through the content using a “Say All” (ins+down arrow) command or “Say Next Line” command (down arrow), the <code>legend</code> is announced when intitally encountered, but no indication of association to related controls is provided:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>filter by</strong> radio button televsion, radio button radio, radio button cinema</p></blockquote>
<p>If the “Move To Next Form Field” (F) command (only available in ‘browse’ mode) is used to move through radio buttons within the <code>fieldset</code> the result is different:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>filter by</strong> radio button television, <strong>filter by</strong> radio button radio, <strong>filter by</strong> radio button cinema</p></blockquote>
<h5>Forms mode</h5>
<p>The results for navigating through controls contained within the <code>fieldset</code> are the same as when the “Move To Next Form Field” command is used, the <code>legend</code> text is prefixed to each control label contained within the fieldset.</p>
<h5>Window Eyes</h5>
<p>Using the default settings <strong>no indication</strong> of the <code>fieldset</code> or <code>legend</code> is announced in any mode. For the user to be made aware of the presence of a <code>fieldset</code>, the user must first modify the Window Eyes browse mode verbosity settings <code>fieldset</code> option:</p>
<blockquote><p>Insert Beginning / End Message (Fieldsets) This option will notify the user of both the beginning and end of a <code>fieldset</code> element.</p></blockquote>
<h6>Browse mode – announce fieldset option enabled</h6>
<p>When this option is enabled, if the user navigates using the down arrow, the start and end of the <code>fieldset</code> is announced as is the <code>legend</code> text:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>filter by fieldset start</strong> radio button television, radio button radio, radio button cinema <strong>filter by fieldset end</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The user can also navigate using the “Next Fieldset” (E) and 
“Previous Fieldset” (shift+E) commands. When these commands are used, 
the end of a fieldset <strong>is not</strong> announced. If the “Next Control” (C), “Previous Control” (shift+C) or the TAB key is used to navigate, <code>fieldsets</code> and <code>legends</code> <strong>are not</strong> announced.</p>
<h6>Using Firefox</h6>
<p>When using Firefox, Window Eyes does not recognize or announce the presence of the <code>fieldset</code> or <code>legend </code>elements. So for example, when using the “Next Fieldset” (E) command “no fieldset” is announced.</p>
<h6>Browse mode off (forms mode)</h6>
<p>When the user is not in browse mode (has to be disabled to for the 
user to interact with edit boxes, text areas and dropdown lists) the 
user is confined to navigating through controls using the TAB key and <strong>no <code>fieldset</code> or <code>legend</code> information</strong> is announced.</p>
<h4>Testing Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>JAWS 8 and Window Eyes 5.5 were used for testing. The <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/fieldset.html">fieldset test page </a>was viewed in Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 on Windows XP.</li>
<li>The examples of screen reader output have been edited to include only pertinent announcements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> elements are a 
useful part of a web developer’s toolkit for making forms more 
accessible to people with disabilities. The support in Window Eyes is 
quite different from the advice given in <abbr title="user agent accessibility guidelines">UAAG</abbr>1.0.
 Due to this, Window Eyes users will not be able to gain the full 
benefit of the additional information provided through the use of these 
elements. In fact no <code>legend</code> text will be announced to users
 unless they first enable an option to announce such information. Even 
when the option is enabled Window Eyes users will not receive this 
important information when they are inputting data into form fields. 
Furthermore if they use Window Eyes in conjunction with the Firefox 
browser no <code>legend</code> or <code>fieldset</code> information will be provided.</p>
<p>The situation for JAWS users is much better. The JAWS implementation is consistent with the advice in <abbr title="user agent accessibility guidelines">UAAG</abbr> 1.0. The grouping of controls using the <code>fieldset</code> is not explicitly announced (as it is in Window Eyes), but the announcing of the fieldset is not advised in <abbr title="user agent accessibility guidelines">UAAG</abbr>
 and may be of limited value or overly obtrusive for the users, which 
could be why it is not enabled by default in Window Eyes. Importantly 
the association of <code>legend</code> text with controls contained within a <code>fieldset</code> is reliably conveyed by the announcement of the <code>legend</code>
 along with a control’s text label. This behaviour works when the user 
is browsing or interacting with form fields and across supported 
browsers.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the advice in <abbr title="user agent accessibility guidelines">UAAG</abbr>
 1.0 and its implementation in JAWS (legend text being announced before a
 control’s label text), developers should be mindful of the length of <code>legend</code> texts, as lengthy <code>legend</code>
 texts have been found to make forms difficult to use. Another potential
 pot hole is the JAWS behaviour when headings are included within a <code>fieldset</code>. In this case JAWS will typically use the heading text in place of the <code>legend</code>
 text, this is a quirk or bug, which can lead to unexpected and 
problematic consequences. This needs to be fixed in JAWS, but until it 
is, perhaps the use of headings within fieldsets should be minimised.</p>
<p>The <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> elements are well 
supported by many user agents. While it is helpful to have knowledge of 
some of the quirks and failings of particular user agents, the poor 
support in software such as Window Eyes <strong>must not stop</strong> 
developers using these elements or accessibility practitioners 
recommending their use. Their use can make it easier for a wide range of
 disabled users to fill out forms. In order to improve accessibility for
 all disabled users, web standards must be adhered to so that developers
 can code for accessibility with confidence. It is the assistive 
technology vendor’s job in these cases to fix their implementations.</p>
