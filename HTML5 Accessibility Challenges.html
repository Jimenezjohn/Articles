						<p>It has been claimed that <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html">HTML5</a>
 will do a lot to improve the accessibility of web content and web based
 applications. In theory this is true. The introduction of new form 
controls in HTML5 is promising, because developers will have to do less 
bolting on of accessibility information themselves, as it will hopefully
 have been bolted on by the browser vendors.</p>

<p>The current accessibility support implemented in browsers lags behind
 their implementations of the sexy new features themselves. These are 
still early days in the implementation of HTML5 features, so lets keep 
our fingers crossed that Google,&nbsp; Apple (Safari on Windows) and 
Opera will get their acts together to provide <em>at least</em> a basic 
level&nbsp; of HTML support in their browsers&nbsp;for assistive 
technology users. Equally it is hoped&nbsp; Mozilla, Apple (Safari on 
Mac) and Microsoft will strive to have their rate of accessibility 
support match their rapid implementation of the new HTML5 features.</p>
<p>Information about accessibility support for implemented HTML5 features is available&nbsp;at <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/">www.HTML5accessibility.com</a>.</p>
<p>The challenge further extends to&nbsp;standardizing the 
implementation of accessibility features.&nbsp;To this end some people 
including myself&nbsp;have started work on a document&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><span>W3C</span></a> called the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-api-map/overview.html">HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide</a> (early draft).</p>
<p>An issue that the implementation guide is being designed to help 
avoid is differences between browsers about how and what information 
they convey to users of assistive technology. For example, Firefox and 
Webkit currently have differing ways of providing labels for form 
controls when using text from the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-placeholder-attribute">HTML5 placeholder attribute</a>,
 this divergence will cause issues for both users and authors as there 
is no clear way to provide a text label that will be uniformly presented
 to users regardless of browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence&nbsp;it is 
planned to include information in the implementation guide&nbsp;on what 
and how to use the content of elements and attributes to provide text 
labels.</p>
