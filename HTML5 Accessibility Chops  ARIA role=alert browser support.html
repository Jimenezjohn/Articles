<span id="more-1605"></span></p>
<h2><code>role=alert</code> what does it do?</h2>
<p>When an element has a <code>role=alert</code> is displayed it 
triggers an alert event in the browsers implemented accessibility APIs. 
This is picked up by assistive technology (AT) and the text content of 
the element is announced, usually suffixed or prefixed by the word 
“alert”. It <strong>does not</strong> move focus in the browser or 
assistive technology to the element, it just causes the text content of 
the element to be announced. This is useful because on screen messages 
can be conveyed to AT users without breaking the flow of their page 
navigation or current focus. They get a similar experience to other 
users when a text message is displayed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#LiveRegions">WAI-ARIA Authoring Guide</a> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/roles#alert"><code>alert</code></a>
 role for a one-time notification which shows for a period of time and 
goes away and is intended to alert the user that something has happened.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><code>role=alert</code> is one of the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2010/04/html5-and-the-myth-of-wai-aria-redundance/">numerous ARIA features</a> that are not available as <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html">native HTML</a> features.</p>
<h2>Different methods</h2>
<p>There are numerous methods for displaying content on the page after 
the page has loaded. Trouble is in some browsers the differing methods <strong>do not</strong> all have the desired effect of triggering the <em>alert</em> event in the browser when <code>role=alert</code> is present on the displayed content.</p>
<h3>Method 1 createElement(), insertAttribute(), createTextNode() and appendchild()</h3>
<p>Using this method a text alert can be displayed on the page by:</p>
<ol>
<li>creating a new element</li>
<li>adding a role attribute with a value of alert</li>
<li>creating the text content</li>
<li>appending the text content to the created element</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this method only currently works with FireFox and Chrome</p>
<h3>Method 2 innerHTML</h3>
<p>Using this method an element with a role attribute with a value of alert and text content can be added to the page:</p>
<p>elementX.innerHTML = “&lt;div role=’alert’&gt;alert text&lt;/div&gt;”;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this method only currently works with FireFox and Chrome</p>
<h3>Method 3 display:none to display:block|inline etc.</h3>
<p>Using this method an element already in the DOM with a role attribute
 with a value of alert and text content can be displayed on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this method only currently works with IE, FireFox and Chrome</p>
<h3>Method 4: createTextNode + constraints</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> unfortunately method 4 is a big hack, but it is the only method that provides support across browsers/AT and platforms.</p>
<p>Using this method, an existing element with no text content can have 
text content added. There are additional constraints on this method to 
make it work with IE, Chrome and Safari (Mac/iPhone/iPad). Working 
example: <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/alert-test-4.html">Test Page – method 4</a></p>
<p><strong>basic:</strong></p>
<pre>alertText = <span>document</span>.createTextNode(<span>"alert text"</span>);
 elementX.appendChild(alertText);</pre>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The element cannot be hidden (For safari) prior to adding the text so used CSS clip() and change before additon of text.</li>
<li>The elements CSS visibility property must be toggled (for IE)</li>
<li>Need an additional <code>role=alert</code> on outer container element and then only set the <code>role=alert</code> on the inner element via scripting prior to adding text.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this&nbsp; outer element has its CSS <code>clip</code> property initially set to <code>rect(0px,0px,0px,0px)</code>, the inner element has <code>role=alert</code> added and the outer element CSS clip property is set to auto via scripting (for Chrome), then <strong>after </strong>(for Safari) the text node is added, the CSS <code>visibility</code> property is toggled (for IE).</p>
<p><strong>HTML:</strong></p>
<pre><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"display2"</span> <span>role</span>=<span>"alert"</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;<span>span</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"add1"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><span><span>function</span> <span>addError</span><span>()</span>{</span>
 
 elem1.setAttribute(<span>"role"</span>, <span>"alert"</span>);
 ? 
 document.getElementById(<span>'display2'</span>).style.clip=<span>'auto'</span>;
 
 alertText = document.createTextNode(<span>"alert via createTextnode()"</span>);
 elem1.appendChild(alertText);
 
 elem1.style.visibility=<span>'hidden'</span>;
 elem1.style.visibility=<span>'visible'</span>;
 }</pre>
<p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>
<pre>
<span>#elem1</span> <span>{

<span><span>clip</span>:<span><span>rect(<span>0</span>px,<span>0</span>px,<span>0</span>px,<span>0</span>px)</span></span></span>;

<span>}</span></span></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this method as described works with FireFox, Chrome, IE on Windows and Safari (Mac, iPhone and iPad?).</p>
<h2>Which browsers support which methods?</h2>
<p>If the display of the alert text triggered an MSAA&nbsp; <code>SYS_ALERT</code> event (on Windows) the method is considered as supporting <code>role=alert</code>,
 after ad hoc testing with NVDA and JAWS.&nbsp; On Mac, iPhone and iPad?
 if VoiceOver announces the alert text the method is considered as 
supporting <code>role=alert</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Results marked with an asterisk indicate that 
while a particular method is supported, support is brittle as , for 
example, an alert is not triggered if the method is reinstantiated on 
the same page after the initial use. In other words the only browser 
with robust support is Firefox.</p>

<h2>Differing browser implementations are a pain in the A</h2>
<p>As can be seen from the above information, due to the IE and Safari support issues getting <code>role=alert</code>
 to work cross browser &amp; cross AT is extremely painful, but as shown
 it is possible. Perhaps I am missing something and a lot simpler 
solution is out there, If so please share!</p>
<h3>Testing methodology</h3>
<div id="attachment_1612" class="wp-caption"><p><img title="Capture" src="HTML5%20Accessibility%20Chops%20%20ARIA%20role=alert%20browser%20support_files/Capture1.png" alt="" width="503" height="106"></p><p class="wp-caption-text">accevent application with a SYS_ALERT event displayed</p></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/alert-test.html">Test page – all methods</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/alert-test-4.html">Test Page – method 4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On Mac, iPhone and iPad, VoiceOver was used with Safari, to test the 
various methods. On windows for Firefox, IE and Chrome, accevent was 
used to listen for the SYS_ALERT event to fire when the text alert was 
displayed. Also JAWS, and NVDA were used to verify wheter the alert text
 was announced.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> JAWS worked fine with IE for all methods as it does not rely upon the SYS_ALERT event, but NVDA only works in IE with <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/alert-test-4.html">method 4</a> as it does rely on the SYS_ALERT event.</p>
