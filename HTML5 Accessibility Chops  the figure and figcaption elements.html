						<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a>
 elements are 2 of the new elements in HTML5. Together they provide the 
promise of being able to mark-up, with meaning, the structure and 
relationship between a piece of content and associated content that acts
 as a descriptive label. Currently as <a href="http://html5accessibility.com/">implemented in browsers</a> the semantics of figure and figcaption are practically non existent.<br>
<span id="more-1074"></span></p>
<h3>What the HTML5 specification says</h3>
<p><strong><code>figure</code> element</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-figure-element">figure</a></code>
 element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that 
is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the 
main flow of the document.</p>
<p>The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, 
photos, code listings, etc, that are referred to from the main content 
of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the 
document, be moved away from that primary content, e.g. to the side of 
the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><code>figcaption</code> element</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The <code>figcaption</code> element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the <code>figcaption</code> element’s parent <code>figure</code> element, if any.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Code example</h3>
<p><code><strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong><br>
<strong>&lt;figcaption&gt;</strong>Figure 1. JavaScript alert code example<strong>&lt;/figcaption&gt;<br>
</strong><br>
&lt;code&gt;<br>
function warning()<br>
{alert('Warning!')}<br>
&lt;/code&gt;</code></p>
<p><code><strong>&lt;/figure&gt;</strong></code></p>
<h3><strong>Current practical meaning conveyed by elements in the example:</strong></h3>
<p><code><del><strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong></del><strong> &lt;div&gt;</strong><br>
<del><strong>&lt;figcaption&gt;</strong></del> <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>Figure 1. JavaScript alert code example<strong> &lt;/div&gt; <del>&lt;/figcaption&gt;</del><br>
</strong><br>
<del>&lt;code&gt;</del> &lt;span&gt;<br>
function warning()<br>
{alert('Warning!')}<br>
<del>&lt;/code&gt;</del> &lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
<p><del><code><strong>&lt;/figure&gt;</strong></code></del><code><strong> &lt;/div&gt;</strong></code></p>
<h3>All very interesting but what can I as a developer do now?</h3>
<p>For the general use cases, until the semantics of <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> have been implemented in browsers and AT it is suggested that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a descriptive word at the start of the <code>figcaption</code> content to give users an idea of what the content is labelling something, for example “Figure X:” or “Chart Y:”</li>
<li>Be consistent in your <code>figcaption</code> labelling within and across pages.</li>
<li>Place the figcaption (in the code) before the content to be labelled so it is announced prior to the content it is labelling.</li>
<li>For example of use with images refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html-alt-techniques-20141023/">HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives</a>:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html-alt-techniques-20141023/#images-of-pictures-1">3.9 Images of Pictures</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html-alt-techniques-20141023/#when-a-text-alternative-is-not-available-at-the-time-of-publication-1">3.12 When a text alternative is unknown at the time of publication</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The background for these recommendations</h2>
<h3>How to convey the semantics?</h3>
<p>The semantics of&nbsp; figcaption can be conveyed visually by the 
placement of the figcaption, above or below the content it labels and 
through its proximity to such content. From observations of how figures 
etc are currently marked up, in some cases the figure element semantics 
will not be indicated visually, though it may be indicated as part of 
the figcaption text and/or by the addition of a border or background 
color. Such visual indications do not provide much value for users who 
cannot make use of them. While proximity provides some indication of a 
semantic relationship it alone does not suffice.</p>
<p>The standard method to convey semantics to assistive technology (AT) 
is by the use of defined roles and relationships provided by <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-api-map/overview.html">Accessibility API’s</a>.
 These roles and relationships are typically mapped to HTML elements by 
the browser and AT accesses the information from the API exposed by the 
browser. A problem arises with figure and figcaption, because figure 
does not have a specified role and while figcaption can be mapped to a 
caption role in some Accessibility API’s others do not provide this 
role. Element names can be passed through accessibility API properties, 
but this does not confer a defined accessibility semantic for a given 
element, thus no common definition of what a particular element is and 
does is provided, this can and does lead to interoperability issues 
across browsers and AT. Making it much harder for both users and 
developers to realize a common user experience across software, devices 
and platforms.</p>
<h3>ARIA to the rescue?</h3>
<p>ARIA can help, but does not offer a complete solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not include a <code>caption</code> role.</li>
<li>It does not include a <code>figure</code> role.</li>
<li><code>aria-labelledby</code> and/or <code>aria-describedby</code> 
may be used to associate figcaption content with figure content, but 
their use does not provide the role semantics to differentiate the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> semantics from the standard labelling methods of the title attribute and in the case of images the alt attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for ARIA to really help it is suggested that the addition of 2 new roles may be required:</p>
<p><strong>caption </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The object contains descriptive information, usually 
textual, about another user interface element such as a table, chart, or
 image.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>figure</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The object is a container for a user interface element such as a table, chart, or image and a caption which labels the element.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Different scenarios</h3>
<p>Whether the additonal roles are needed depends on what will provide 
the best user experience. Do users want to be made aware of both 
structures? Should the figcaption content be associated with the figure 
or the content it contains? Should none , one or both of the structures 
be voiced by AT? Should&nbsp; the caption always be announced prior to 
the figure content or after or depend on the caption placement 
(before/after)?</p>
<h4>The following scenarios are also available on a <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/figure-scenarios.html">test page</a> which has the role information included inline to simulate what would be available to the AT user for each scenario.</h4>
<h4><strong>Scenario 1</strong></h4>
<p>The presence of both figure and caption are announced, the figure 
start and end are voiced. the caption is announced before the content. 
(Simulates the figure being labelled by the figcaption)</p>
<h4><strong>Scenario 2</strong></h4>
<p>The presence of figure but <strong>not caption</strong> is announced,
 the figure start and end are voiced. the caption content is announced 
before the figure content. (Simulates the figure being labelled by the 
figcaption)</p>
<h4><strong>Scenario 3</strong></h4>
<p>The presence of caption but <strong>not figure</strong> is announced, the caption content is announced <strong>before</strong> the figure content. (Simulates the figure content being labelled by the figcaption)</p>
<h4><strong>Scenario 5</strong></h4>
<p>The presence of caption but <strong>not figure</strong> is announced, the caption content is announced <strong>after </strong>the figure content. (Simulates the figure being labelled by the figcaption)</p>
<h4><strong>Scenario 5</strong></h4>
<p>The presence of caption or figure is not announced, the caption 
content is announced dependent on the placement in the code 
(before/after)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Scenario 5 is what users currently experience.</p>
<h4><strong>Code example for all scenarios</strong></h4>
<p><code><strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong></code></p><code>

<h3>What do users want?</h3>
<p>I have coded a <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/figure-scenarios.html">test page</a>
 with examples, from the scenarios above, simulating what information 
could be announced and ordered, please give it a try in your favourite 
AT and provide comments.</p>
