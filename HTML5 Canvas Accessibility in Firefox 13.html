						<p>The recently released <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/13.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 13</a> implements the HTML5 specification’s <code>canvas</code> element fallback concept. This means that the content inside a <code>canvas</code>
 elements start and end tags is exposed to assistive technology users 
even when the browser supports canvas. It also means that any 
interactive elements, inside a <code>canvas</code> elements start and end tags such as links or form controls will be included in a documents default tab order <em>even</em> when the browser supports canvas.</p>

<h3>Canvas in Firefox 13 has a navigable sub DOM</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element">HTML specification states</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><p>When a <code>canvas</code> element represents embedded content, the user can still focus descendants of the <code>canvas</code>
 element (in the fallback content). When an element is focused, it is 
the target of keyboard interaction events (even though the element 
itself is not visible). This allows authors to make an interactive 
canvas keyboard-accessible: authors should have a one-to-one mapping of 
interactive regions to focusable elements in the fallback content. 
(Focus has no effect on mouse interaction events.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Which translates as meaning the content inside a <code>canvas</code> element:</p>
<p>If interactive, should be included in the tab order and operable with
 the keyboard. All content is accessible to assistive technology such as
 screen readers. So in the <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">canvas example</a>, the text alternative should be announced by screen readers and the links are navigable and operable using the keyboard.</p>
<p>Until now, this behaviour had only been implemented in Internet 
Explorer 9, but with the release of Firefox 13, there are now 2 browsers
 that&nbsp; implement support as per the HTML5 specification. So if you 
are using Firefox 13 or IE9 with the keyboard to navigate interactive 
elements, you can tab to the links in the <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">canvas example</a>. If you are using a screen reader, you can also access the text alternative (in this case) content inside the <code>canvas</code> element.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Some Potential Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where content is currently included in canvas, it is almost 
exclusively of the “get a better browser that supports canvas” variety, 
so screen reader users will encounter this when using Firefox 13 or IE9.</li>
<li>Authors will most likely continue to provide useless information (for screen reader users) as the general definition of “<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#fallback-content">fallback content</a>” in the HTML5 specification is at odds with how <code>canvas</code> content is presented to keyboard and AT users in browsers that support the <code>canvas</code> element and at odds with how the term is used in reference to other <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#embedded-content">embedded content</a> elements where the fallback content is <strong>ONLY</strong> available to users if the prmary content is not supported.</li>
<li>Keyboard focus is lost if interactive elements are included inside the canvas, because while elements inside the <code>canvas</code>
 element are focusable by default, there is no corresponding default 
indication of focus to identify where current focus is. This means that 
developers <strong>must</strong> provide pseudo focus rings that are displayed when an interactive element in the canvas sub DOM receives focus, <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">an example</a> of this is provided triggered by inline (for demo purposes only) onfocus/onblur event handlers. There is <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#drawing-paths-to-the-canvas">a proposal</a> for dedicated <code>canvas </code>API methods for the display of focus rings, but these have not yet been agreed upon or implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developers Be(a)ware</h2>
<p>In Firefox 13+ and IE 9+ HTML content inside the <code>canvas</code> 
element is now available at all times to assistive technology users and 
keyboard users can&nbsp;operate links and controls and they are included
 in the default tab order. So please provide alternatives to on screen 
canvas content and interactivity in the <code>canvas</code> sub DOM. <strong>DO NOT</strong> include a <em>dumb</em> message telling the user that they need to get a browser that supports canvas!</p>
<h2>HTML5 definition of ‘<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#fallback-content">fallback content</a>‘</h2>
<blockquote><p>Some embedded content elements can have <dfn id="fallback-content">fallback content</dfn>:
 content that is to be used when the external resource cannot be used 
(e.g. because it is of an unsupported format). The element definitions 
state what the fallback is, if any.</p></blockquote>
<p>This general definition of fallback content is problematic, because 
in the case of canvas and how its use pertains to assistive technology 
and keyboard users. In Firefox 13 and IE 9 the canvas element is 
supported, so the content in the sub DOM is not fallback. The example I 
provided could&nbsp; have had hit testing on the shapes drawn on the 
canvas so that a click event could be passed to the links in the sub 
DOM. The use of the term ‘fallback’ for the contents of the sub DOM 
helps to mislead developers about sub DOM use. An example of erroneous 
information is provided in the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eV6yL162Kw">HTML5 Canvas Fallback Content Tutorial</a></p>
