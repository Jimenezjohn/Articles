						<p>All modern browser implement the HTML5 specification’s <code>canvas</code> element fallback concept. This means that the content inside a <code>canvas</code>
 elements start and end tags is exposed to assistive technology users 
even when the browser supports canvas. It also means that any 
interactive elements, inside a <code>canvas</code> elements start and end tags such as links or form controls will be included in a documents default tab order <em>even</em> when the browser supports canvas.</p>

<h3>Canvas has a navigable sub DOM</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element">HTML5 specification states</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><p>When a <code>canvas</code> element represents embedded content, the user can still focus descendants of the <code>canvas</code>
 element (in the fallback content). When an element is focused, it is 
the target of keyboard interaction events (even though the element 
itself is not visible). This allows authors to make an interactive 
canvas keyboard-accessible: authors should have a one-to-one mapping of 
interactive regions to focusable elements in the fallback content. 
(Focus has no effect on mouse interaction events.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Which translates as meaning the content inside a <code>canvas</code> element:</p>
<p>If interactive, should be included in the tab order and operable with
 the keyboard. All content is accessible to assistive technology such as
 screen readers. So in the <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">canvas example</a>, the text alternative should be announced by screen readers and the links are navigable and operable using the keyboard.</p>
<p>If you are using any modern browser with the keyboard to navigate interactive elements, you can tab to the links in the <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">canvas example</a>. If you are using a screen reader, you can also access the text alternative (in this case) content inside the <code>canvas</code> element.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">Canvas example</a> HTML code:</h3>
<pre><span>&lt;<span>canvas</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"example"</span> <span>width</span>=<span>"260"</span> <span>height</span>=<span>"200"</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink
circle. Partially overlaying the

<span>onfocus</span>=<span>"drawCircle();"</span> <span>onblur</span>=<span>"drawPicture();"</span>&gt;</span>circle<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>.

</ul>
<h3>Some Potential Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where content is currently included in canvas, it is almost 
exclusively of the “get a better browser that supports canvas” variety, 
so screen reader users will encounter this when using any modern 
browser.</li>
<li>Authors will most likely continue to provide useless information (for screen reader users) as the general definition of “<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#fallback-content">fallback content</a>” in the HTML5 specification is at odds with how <code>canvas</code> content is presented to keyboard and AT users in browsers that support the <code>canvas</code> element and at odds with how the term is used in reference to other <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#embedded-content">embedded content</a> elements where the fallback content is <strong>ONLY</strong> available to users if the prmary content is not supported.</li>
<li>Keyboard focus is lost if interactive elements are included inside the canvas, because while elements inside the <code>canvas</code>
 element are focusable by default, there is no corresponding default 
indication of focus to identify where current focus is. This means that 
developers <strong>must</strong> provide pseudo focus rings that are displayed when an interactive element in the canvas sub DOM receives focus, <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/canvas.html">an example</a> of this is provided triggered by inline (for demo purposes only) onfocus/onblur event handlers. There is <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#drawing-paths-to-the-canvas">a proposal</a> for dedicated <code>canvas </code>API methods for the display of focus rings, but these have not yet been agreed upon or implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developers Be(a)ware</h2>
<p>In Firefox and IE and Chrome and Opera and Safari HTML content inside the <code>canvas</code>
 element is available at all times to assistive technology users and 
keyboard users can&nbsp;operate links and controls and they are included
 in the default tab order. So please provide alternatives to on screen 
canvas content and interactivity in the <code>canvas</code> sub DOM. <strong>DO NOT</strong> include a <em>dumb</em> message telling the user that they need to get a browser that supports canvas!</p>
<h2>HTML5 definition of ‘<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#fallback-content">fallback content</a>‘</h2>
<blockquote><p>Some embedded content elements can have <dfn id="fallback-content">fallback content</dfn>:
 content that is to be used when the external resource cannot be used 
(e.g. because it is of an unsupported format). The element definitions 
state what the fallback is, if any.</p></blockquote>
<p>This general definition of <em>fallback content</em> is problematic, 
because in the case of canvas and how its use pertains to assistive 
technology and keyboard users. In modern browsers the &lt;canvas&gt; 
element is supported, so the content in the sub DOM is not fallback. The
 example I provided could&nbsp; have had hit testing on the shapes drawn
 on the canvas so that a click event could be passed to the links in the
 sub DOM. The use of the term ‘fallback’ for the contents of the sub DOM
 helps to mislead developers about sub DOM use. An example of erroneous 
information is provided in the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eV6yL162Kw">HTML5 Canvas Fallback Content Tutorial</a></p>
