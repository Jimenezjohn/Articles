<h3>Stating the obvious</h3>
<p>Semantics are not just about accessibility, accessibility is not just
 about assistive technology. But semantic information (name, role, 
states and properties) carried by HTML elements and attributes is 
integral to making content on the web accessible, especially for those 
who rely upon assistive technology to access and interact with web 
content.<br>
Historically and currently accessibility support for HTML features in 
browsers lags behind other facets of feature implementation, and 
unfortunately accessibility support is not taken into account when 
browsers announce support for a feature. Which is why we get claims 
about HTML5 structural elements being implemented in browsers. What is 
actually meant, pretty much, is that visual styling has been 
implemented.</p>
<h3>HTML accessibility support</h3>
<p>Where there are clearly defined semantics already available via <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2011/10/brief-history-of-browser-accessibility-support/">acccessibility APIs</a>
 for new HTML5 features, it is easy for browsers to implement the 
support and no excuse for AT to not understand and convey the 
appropriate information to users.<br>
The accessibility implementation and semantics of particular HTML5 
elements is still being worked out. This is mostly due to the semantics,
 from an accessibility support perspective, not being well specified or 
specified at all in the HTML5 specification. The <a href="http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/html-aam/html-aam.html">HTML to accessibility API implementation guide</a> is intended to help with this, but it is still in early development</p>
<h3>hgroup – an element in search of a cowpath</h3>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/sections.html#the-hgroup-element">hgroup element</a>
 is a mess. Why? because it is an element in search of a cowpath. As 
currently specified it does not provide a useful semantic to assistive 
technology users, in fact it does the opposite, it removes potential 
information about subheadings/subtitles/taglines etc, by forcing 
implementers to collapse the subheading semantics into the parent 
heading. That is why hgroup is at risk in the W3C HTML5 specification, 
with <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html#ISSUE-164">5 detailed proposals</a> to either abolish or replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 22/02/2015: hgroup is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">obsolete in HTML5</a></p>
<h3>header – useful or not?</h3>
<p>Another example is the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/sections.html#the-header-element">header</a> element from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610650">discussions</a>
 with browser and AT implementers, it is considered that the header 
element does not add much value as it does not provide anything that 
currently available semantics does not. To understand why, it is useful 
understand the ways in which screen readers can expose <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2011/03/html5-accessibility-chops-section-elements/">HTML element information</a> to users. As a consequence it may well not be implemented in browsers or AT.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 22/02/2105: A <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-header-element">header</a> element that is not a descendant of an <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-article-element">article</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#the-section-element">section</a> element is exposed with a banner role (as per <a href="http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/">HTML5 implementation requirements</a>) in all modern browsers, except Internet Explorer.</p>
<h3>HTML5 outline algorithm</h3>
<p>In regards to the outline algorithm, Jeremy states “The new outline 
algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive 
technology” which suggests that he is not aware of the implementation of
 the <a href="http://www.accessibleculture.org/articles/2011/10/jaws-ie-and-headings-in-html5/">outline algorithm in JAWS 12/13</a>,
 unfortunately the current implementation can actually undermine users 
ability to navigate and understand document structure. Note, also it 
does not take hgroup into account.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 22/02/2015: The outline algorithm is still <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Usage/Headings/h1only">not implemented in browsers</a> and the JAWS implementation was removed in JAWS 14.</p>
<h3>figure and figcaption – meaning in the pipeline</h3>
<p>The figure and figcaption elements currently have no semantic 
meaning. This is partly because the semantics are not defined in 
accessibility APIs and partly because the available role semantics and 
labelling relationships have not yet been implemented in browsers. There
 is active work going on to change that.&nbsp; As part of working out 
how the semantics of these new elements could work I wrote <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2011/11/2011/08/html5-accessibility-chops-the-figure-and-figcaption-elements/" rel="nofollow">a post about the challenges of defining the semantics</a>. At the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/11/TPAC/">W3C TPAC meetings</a>
 last week we discussed the addition of a figure role in ARIA 1.1. There
 is also moves afoot to add a figure role to the iAccessible2 API, and 
Firefox are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=658272" rel="nofollow">making progress (Firefox bug)</a> on the implementation of the labelling relationship for figcaption/figure and role implementation for figcaption.</p>
<h3>Browsers have an integral part to play in accessibility support</h3>
<p>For a long time, the refrain from certain quarters has been, screen 
readers don’t support feature X its been in HTMLX for ages, F#@King 
screen reader vendors. They are an easy target. Part of what <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/">HTML5Acessibility</a>
 was set up to do was draw attention to the browser vendors role in 
providing accessibility support. I suggest that browser implementation 
is an integral aspect of HTML accessibility support, without it there is
 not chance of robust, interoperable access to web content for AT users.
 Take a look at the debacle with longdesc, AT for the most part cannot 
be relied upon, and should not need to be relied upon to implement 
accessibility features, without the browsers doing their part.</p>
<h3>HTML5 a work in progress, get involved!</h3>
<p>HTML5 is still a work in progress, but it’s at a stage now where 
significant changes must not be handed down from upon high, the 
community must have the opportunity to be involved in affecting change. 
Involvement in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">W3C HTML working group</a> provides that opportunity, get involved!</p>
