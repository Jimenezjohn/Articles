<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Before discussing JAWS support for ARIA, it’s important to understand
 the relationship between the ARIA markup itself, the browser in which 
the markup is rendered, and JAWS as it provides spoken or Braille 
information to users.</p>
<p>First, ARIA markup was designed to insert information useful to 
assistive technologies into existing HTML code. It exists as a way to 
label controls and to provide information about their states. But adding
 ARIA support to a Web page does not change the presentation or behavior
 of that Web page to sighted users. For example, adding the ARIA role of
 “checkbox” to a “div” tag within a Web page will produce no visible 
effect on the page. Instead, if there is a check box on the page which 
has been rendered without using the “input” tag, the ARIA role of 
“checkbox” can be added to the code to inform assistive technology users
 that a check box appears at that point on the page.</p>
<p>Second, the browser plays a big role in interpreting ARIA markup. 
Most browsers support some type of accessibility API (application 
programming interface), and assistive technologies use the API to get 
information about what is presented on the screen. So, ARIA markup is 
transformed by the browser into information that fits the accessibility 
API it supports. Then, the information provided by the API is consumed 
by the assistive technology. That means JAWS support of ARIA depends 
heavily on the browser being used.</p>
<p>Third, JAWS gathers information from the ARIA markup and the 
browser’s API and presents it in a meaningful way to screen reader 
users. Because of the above interactions, the quality of JAWS support 
for ARIA markup is inextricably tied to the careful, thorough 
application of ARIA markup on a Web page, and comprehensive support 
provided by the browser in which the markup is rendered.</p>
<p>For best results, Freedom Scientific recommends that Web page authors read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/">ARIA best practices guide</a>
 carefully before adding ARIA markup to their pages. Also, concepts such
 as roles, states, landmarks, and so on are defined as part of the ARIA 
specification, and are therefore not defined in this document. If you 
are unfamiliar with these concepts please read through the ARIA 
documentation before continuing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the reasons described above, there may be 
differences in JAWS ARIA support between IE and Firefox. Please test any
 examples in both browsers. And please specify which browser you’re 
using when reporting problems to Freedom Scientific.</p>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>It’s a good idea to have a firm grasp of the following concepts. 
These items form the basis of many descriptions throughout the document.</p>
<h3>Virtual Cursor</h3>
<p>JAWS presents Web pages using the JAWS Virtual Cursor. This allows 
users to read and navigate a Web page as though it were a text document.
 Users press the arrow keys to read line by line, word by word, 
character by character, and so on. JAWS also provides quick navigation 
keys, which are alpha-numeric keys that move the Virtual Cursor to 
features of the page such as links, headings, and form controls. In 
addition, users can press the <strong>TAB</strong> key to move between focusable elements on the page.</p>
<p>Using the arrow keys or quick nav keys to change the position of the 
Virtual Cursor does not change the actual focus point in the 
application. This means that even if JAWS reads the text of a given link
 on a Web page for example, that link doesn’t necessarily have the 
keyboard focus. Note: The keyboard focus is typically represented 
visually as a highlighted area surrounding a control.</p>
<p>Conversely, pressing the <strong>TAB</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> key to navigate moves the focus point and the Virtual Cursor follows the focus.</p>
<h3>Forms mode</h3>
<p>Because JAWS uses the arrow keys and alpha-numeric keys for Virtual 
Cursor navigation, these keyboard commands are not passed through to 
interactive controls (form fields) on the page. This approach has the 
added benefit of protecting users from inadvertently changing form field
 values or activating controls on the page while simply reviewing the 
content.</p>
<p>Forms mode is when JAWS turns over processing of the above keys to 
form controls so that users can interact with them. For example, when 
using the Virtual Cursor, pressing the letter F moves the Virtual Cursor
 to the next form field on the Web page; in forms mode, pressing the 
letter F types the character “f”.</p>
<h3>Auto Forms Mode</h3>
<p>Before JAWS 10, JAWS users had to enter and exit forms mode manually.
 Users navigated to a given control using the Virtual Cursor, and would 
then press the <strong>ENTER</strong> key to go into forms mode. The PC Cursor key (<strong>NUMPAD PLUS</strong>) caused JAWS to exit forms mode.</p>
<p>When forms mode is manually activated on a given form control, focus is set to that control.</p>
<p>Auto forms mode is a feature that tells JAWS to be smart about when 
to enter and exit forms mode. This is a setting which is on by default. 
This approach provides a seamless experience for JAWS users when both 
reading and interacting with a Web page.</p>
<p>The behavior of auto forms mode depends on the type of form field in 
question and the keyboard command used to navigate to it. The following 
is a description of the keyboard commands and how they affect Web page 
form fields:</p>
<p><strong>ARROW Keys:</strong></p>
<p>When the Virtual Cursor is active, JAWS enters forms mode upon 
encountering an edit field. Focus is moved to the edit control, and 
users can begin typing.</p>
<p>In forms mode, the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys move the caret within the edit field.</p>
<p>In forms mode, if an <strong>ARROW</strong> key is pressed and the 
caret has already reached the boundary of the edit field, JAWS exits 
forms mode and resumes using the Virtual Cursor.</p>
<p>In forms mode, pressing <strong>ESC</strong> or <strong>NUMPAD PLUS</strong> will cause JAWS to exit forms mode.</p>
<p>Edit fields are the only controls for which JAWS enters or exits 
forms mode automatically based on the arrow keys. For other controls, if
 JAWS is using the Virtual Cursor, it will continue to use the Virtual 
Cursor. This is so that users don’t accidentally change the value of a 
control while attempting simply to navigate past it. If JAWS is already 
in forms mode, <strong>ARROW</strong> keys will not cause JAWS to leave 
forms mode. This is so that users won’t unintentionally leave forms mode
 while interacting with a control. When <strong>ARROW</strong> keys are used to navigate to non-edit controls, users must activate forms mode manually by pressing <strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>TAB Keys:</strong></p>
<p>Using the <strong>TAB</strong> key always causes the focus point to 
move. When focus changes to a given form control, JAWS auto forms mode 
activates forms mode based on the type of the control in question.</p>
<p>For edit fields, combo boxes, spin controls, list controls, tab 
controls, menu bars, tree views, and grid cells, JAWS enters forms mode 
automatically.</p>
<p>For buttons and check boxes, JAWS exits forms mode.</p>
<p>In forms mode, pressing <strong>ESC</strong> or <strong>NUMPAD PLUS</strong> will cause JAWS to exit forms mode.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to move to a form field by using <strong>TAB</strong> keys and to move away from that form field using <strong>ARROW</strong> keys, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Different Control Types:</strong></p>
<p>In terms of Forms Mode, there are two groups of controls: those that 
require Forms Mode to interact with them, and those controls that never 
require Forms Mode to interact with them.</p>
<p>Forms Mode is required for&nbsp;edit fields, combo boxes, spin 
controls, list controls, tab controls, menu bars, tree views, and grid 
cells. For these controls, press <strong>ENTER</strong> or <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to enter Forms Mode, and <strong>ESC</strong> or <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> to exit Forms Mode.</p>
<p>For buttons and check boxes, use <strong>ENTER</strong> or <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the control at the location of the Virtual Cursor. Users interact with these controls simply by pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> or <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>;
 so forms mode is unnecessary. Auto Forms Mode causes JAWS to leave 
Forms Mode when it encounters these control types because they are just 
as usable without Forms Mode.</p>
<p>For combo boxes only, <strong>ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong> causes JAWS to enter Forms Mode and drop down the list of combo box items. <strong>ALT+UP ARROW</strong> closes the list of combo box items and causes JAWS to exit Forms Mode.</p>
<p>Finally, JAWS Auto Forms Mode behavior for radio buttons is a little 
different from its behavior with other types of controls. This is 
because unlike other controls, it is possible to interact with radio 
buttons in both Forms Mode and with the Virtual Cursor. When navigating 
with the <strong>TAB</strong> key, JAWS will stay in Forms Mode if it is already on, and it will not enter Forms Mode if it is off. Users can press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose a specific radio button when using the Virtual Cursor, and pressing the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys will not change the value of the radio button group. Users can also press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate Forms Mode, and subsequent presses of the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>
 keys will change the value of the radio button group. The following 
table contains the expected behavior for radio buttons with Auto Forms 
Mode.</p>

<h3>Forms Mode and Application Controls</h3>
<p>A page author may mark up a Web page using the ARIA role of 
application.&nbsp; This role indicates that the page author takes 
responsibility for handling of the <strong>ARROW</strong> and <strong>ESC</strong>
 keys while the cursor is inside the application region.&nbsp; The goal 
is to have JAWS act as though it is inside a standard desktop 
application. This means that as the user tabs from control to control, 
JAWS will remain in Forms Mode and pass on all <strong>ARROW</strong> keys and the ESC key to the Web page.</p>
<p>When inside an application region, JAWS treats any interactive 
element as a form control. This means that links, checkboxes, radio 
buttons, and so on are all treated like form controls requiring forms 
mode. This is in contrast to the manual and auto Forms Mode behaviors 
described earlier in this document. However, as with Forms Mode in other
 circumstances, users are still able to exit Forms Mode on application 
controls by pressing <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> and they can re-enter Forms Mode either by tabbing to a new control or by pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> on a control.</p>
<p>The user can identify controls inside an application region because 
they are all announced as “application controls” by jaws as the user 
moves through the Web page using <strong>TAB</strong> or the <strong>ARROW</strong>
 keys. For example, when a user encounters a link to google inside an 
application region, JAWS will announce, “application control link 
google.” An edit control will be announced as “edit application 
control.”</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> there is no distinction between regions of the
 page marked as applications and the case where the entire Web page is 
marked as an application. Previous versions of JAWS treated 
role=”application” on the body of a page differently from 
role=”application in other parts of a Web page. Note also that if a 
region is marked as a document and this region is inside an application 
region, the controls inside the document are treated as ordinary form 
controls and the standard forms mode behavior applies.</p>
<h4>Note for developers</h4>
<p>Controls containing text and without a visible caret should not be 
given a role of application, nor should they be nested inside an element
 with role of application.</p>
<p>This is because when a user tabs to such an item they will automatically be in a mode in which they can’t use the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys to review the text with out explicitly leaving application mode, something that isn’t intuitive.</p>
<p>If you have a block of text meeting the above criteria nested within 
an application, you can give sucha block a role of document or nest it 
within an element with role of document.</p>
<p>If you expect the user to be able to tab to this area, be sure to give it an appropriate tabindex.</p>

<h2>ARIA Roles</h2>
<p>The ARIA roles listed below are common control types that should be 
familiar to Windows users. These are controls that have been supported 
by JAWS in the Windows operating system for many years. Therefore, the 
expected behavior for each control type is not presented in detail. 
Sufficed to say, in Forms Mode, JAWS should behave comparably between 
controls presented on Web pages and their counterparts in standard 
desktop applications. Likewise, most of these control types have existed
 in HTML for a long time, and JAWS has supported those controls using 
the Virtual Cursor. In Virtual Cursor mode, JAWS behavior between a 
combo box created with standard HTML for example should be no different 
from JAWS behavior with a properly constructed JavaScript-based combo 
box and ARIA markup. In a few cases, ARIA markup allows for control 
types which were not available before in HTML. In these cases, notes may
 appear next to the roles in question.</p>
<p>An important thing to understand about ARIA roles is that several 
roles may be combined to form the framework of one control on a page. 
For example, an editable grid consists of an object with the role of 
“grid”, having children with the role of “row”, having children with the
 role of “rowheader”, “columnheader”, or “gridcell”. Such controls are 
composed of expected patterns of roles which are described in the ARIA 
best practices document. If the construction of these controls is done 
in a way other than that described by the best practices document, JAWS 
may not behave as the author intends.</p>
<p>Furthermore, states and roles also relate closely to one another. 
ARIA roles have a list of valid states provided in the ARIA 
documentation. Although the specific set of states supported by JAWS is 
not listed with each role, a reasonable standard of common usage applies
 to the acceptable states for each role. For example, the state of 
“aria-required” makes no sense when applied to a graphic. And the state 
of “aria-readonly” is superfluous when applied to a check box. JAWS 
attempts to filter out extraneous information for certain control types.
 So, page Authors should use the ARIA documentation as a guide, and 
report any discrepancies to Freedom Scientific.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some supported roles, such as those for 
landmark regions, have been omitted from the below list, but will be 
discussed later in this document.</p>

<h3>ARIA States</h3>
<p>The same principle of reasonable common usage applies to ARIA states as applied above to roles.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some states, such as those related to drag and
 drop, have been omitted from the below list, but will be discussed 
later in this document.</p>
<p>The following is a list of states which JAWS recognizes:</p>

<h3>ARIA Relationships</h3>
<p>Using ARIA, a page author can specify relationships among elements. JAWS supports the use of the following relationships:</p>

<h3>Document Regions</h3>
<p>JAWS announces the type and text of document regions, and provides 
navigation to the next and previous document region on the page using 
the <strong>SEMICOLON</strong> and <strong>SHIFT+SEMICOLON</strong> Navigation Quick Keys. In addition, pressing <strong>INSERT+CONTROL+SEMICOLON</strong>
 brings up a list of document regions. Note that JAWS treats a number of
 elements as regions. This includes all the ARIA landmark regions along 
with several other region types listed below. This table also provides 
the text JAWS uses in the virtual buffer to indicate the start of a 
region.</p>

<h3>Live Regions</h3>
<p>JAWS supports use of the “aria-live” attribute and any of its 
acceptable values: “polite”, “assertive”, or “off”. JAWS will also treat
 regions with the ARIA role of “log” or “status” as a live region. In 
addition, JAWS supports use of the “aria-atomic” state on live regions. 
JAWS does&nbsp; support use of the “aria-relevant” state in firefox.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Since the “aria-live” value of “rude” is no 
longer supported by the standard, the use of it is deprecated in JAWS, 
but still supported.</p>
<h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
<p>JAWS supports the ARIA drag-and-drop properties “aria-grabbed” and 
“aria-dropeffect”. When a Web page author applies these properties to 
objects on a Web page, JAWS will identify such objects as grabbable, 
grabbed, or droppable.</p>
<p><strong>The keystroke WINDOWS Key+CTRL+EQUALS</strong> opens the ARIA
 Drag and Drop dialog box, which shows a list of droppable objects on 
the page. When you select one of these objects, JAWS will move focus to 
it. If no droppable objects are available, JAWS will announce the 
message, “No droppable elements were found on the page” instead of 
opening the dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> JAWS does not implement the drag and drop 
functionality in the sense that JAWS doesn’t grab or drop objects 
itself. According to the ARIA specification, that functionality should 
be provided by the page author. JAWS simply announces to the user that a
 given element is grabbable, grabbed, or droppable.</p></div></div></div>
