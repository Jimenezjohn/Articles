						<p>As part of my presentation at the <a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/accessibility2/">Accessibility 2.0 Conference</a>
 I demonstrated a preferences module conceived by Hans Hillen, Gez Lemon
 and I, as a proof of concept(s) for ways to provide cues to users 
allowing them to benefit from and/or have access to content that changes
 dynamically without a page refresh. <span id="more-2499"></span>This was presented using the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>
 character countdown feature, which indicates to users the number of 
characters (140 character limit) they have left to type into a <code>textarea</code>.</p>
<p>The TPG notifier includes 3 methods to inform a user of how many 
letters they have left to type in a text area, before the limit is 
reached. The 3 methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>JavaScript alert</li>
<li>Flash aural cues</li>
<li>WAI-ARIA Live regions</li>
</ol>
<p>Each method has its pros and cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The JavaScript alert requires that focus be moved away from the text
 area to the alert box and the user to press the ‘OK’ button for the 
focus to be moved back to its previous position in the text area. But 
this method is probably the most widely supported across browsers and 
Assistive Technology.</li>
<li>The Flash method involves the use of reasonably complex JavaScript 
and the production of the aural cue files. But is well supported and 
does not require the AT to support Flash, only that the Browser has the 
Flash plugin installed.</li>
<li>The WAI-ARIA live region method is easily implemented, but currently has limited support.</li>
</ol>
<p>As previously stated this is a ‘proof of concept’ and has not been 
tested with assistive technology users. The most important aspect is 
that it provides <strong>Preferences, </strong>which a user can enable if they choose to. So users are not forced to use any method if they don’t find them useful.</p>
<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://files.paciellogroup.com/blogmisc/samples/tpgnotifier/index.html?notificationMethod=liveregion">working example</a> or download the <a href="http://files.paciellogroup.com/blogmisc/samples/tpgnotifier/notifier.zip">example sourcecode (zip file)</a>.
 The example has WAI-ARIA live regions, with a visual fade indicator, 
set as default. If live regions are unsupported by a user’s browser or 
Assistive Technology, they can choose from the other methods available.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>Hans Hillen took on the task of developing the concept (thanks Hans!) and provides information on the technical details:</p>
<p>The TPG notifier can be created as a javascript object by a developer
 for any specific page. It uses unobtrusive scripting, but does not fall
 back on a non scripted alternative. User agents that do not support 
javascript simply will not receive the updates.</p>
<p>The notifier object allows developers to create different 
notifications, which can then be sent to the user at any suitable event.
 Currently there are three different notification types: Auditory Icons 
(using Adobe Flash), browser alerts, and live regions. The key factor is
 that the end user can decide which method to use, based on his or her 
preference and level of support. The Notifier class is easy to extend, 
allowing additional notification alternatives to be added in the future.
 For now, let’s have a closer look at the available methods:</p>
<h3>Audio Updates Using Adobe Flash</h3>
<p>With this approach, we use Flash to play back sound as a result of a 
particular event. The Flash movie is a 5kb file that does not contain 
any actual visual content, only scripted behaviour that handles the 
loading and playback of sound files. This approach does not require the 
user to interact with the flash movie at all, as this is all handled by 
JavaScript. To prevent users from being hassled with messages about 
missing plugins or plugin versions, we have used the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">swfobject 2.0</a> method (developed by<a href="http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/"> Bobby van der Sluis</a>).
 Swfobject makes it easy to inject Flash content to a document in an 
unobtrusive, cross browser friendly way. This approach also makes use of
 the TPG notifier a lot easier, as the developer does not have to worry 
about manually implementing flash objects on every page, the TPG 
notifier takes care of this. Also, when a user agent is not capable of 
playing Flash content, this method will degrade gracefully without 
bothering the end users about missing plugins. Since the notifier has 
different notification methods next to Flash, supporting Flash is not 
crucial. The Notifier object will switch the notification method to 
something that does not require a plugin (currently it will switch to 
the ‘live region’ method).</p>
<p>The sound files have be in mp3 format. These can be simple and short 
sound files (such as a beep) , speech recordings, or anything that’s 
appropriate. Also, different types of alerts can be created using the 
same sound file, by manipulating volume, spacial position and 
repetition. For example, the demo provided with this article generates 
three alerts, based on the remaining number of characters left in a text
 area. Using the preferences section you can choose to either use a 
different sound for each event, or to use the same sound but louder for 
each event. Have a look at the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/notifier/prefs.html">preferences section of the demo</a> to get an idea of the possibilities.</p>
<h3>Using JavaScript alerts</h3>
<p>A method that is more natively supported by most browsers is the use 
of browser alerts (e.g. window.alert() calls). The main disadvantage of 
this approach is that it is disruptive to the user’s browsing 
experience. For this reason, this method should never be a default 
setting when using the notifier. It should only be used when chosen by 
the user. Next to the wide level of support, there is another advantage 
for this approach: the fact that the alert box is modal and always draws
 focus to itself provides a guarantee that the user will perceive the 
notification. Also, even though it steals focus, it always places it 
back to where it was.</p>
<h3>Using ARIA Live Regions</h3>
<p><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/AJAX:WAI_ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA Live regions</a>
 are ideal for notifying users of changed content. The TPG notifier can 
be used to either create a new live region from scratch to place the 
notification text in, or an existing element can be targeted to function
 as a live region. The notifier also takes a set of parameters that 
determine how the live region will be created. For your visitors to try 
this method out, they will need a browser that supports live regions 
(such as <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox </a>), as well as compatible assistive technology (such as <a href="http://www.firevox.clcworld.net/">Firevox</a>, <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a> or <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Firefox/LiveRegions">ORCA</a>).</p>
<h3>To Implement</h3>
<p>The Notifier requires a few files to be present in your site 
structure (and the javascript files will have to be loaded in this 
order:</p>
<ul>
<li>swfobject.js, which contains the swfobject code responsible for injecting flash into the page.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/notifier/js/tpglib/TPG/Utilities.js">TPG/Utilities.js</a>, which contains core functions used by the notifier.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/notifier/js/tpglib/TPG/Notifier.js">TPG/Notifier.js</a>, which contains the actual notifier related classes.</li>
<li>TPG/tpgnotifier.swf, which is the actual flash file responsible for 
loading and playing the sounds. The functionality is is located in the <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/misc/notifier/flash/TPG/SoundHandler.as">SoundHander.as</a> file.</li>
<li>Additionally MP3 files will have to be provided by the developer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, these are the steps that have to be undertaken to implement the TPG notifier in your page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new instance of the TPG.Notifier class. The constructor 
takes two parameters: the method to use, and an optional object that can
 be used to pass configuration parameters to the notifier. Since the 
user has to be able to choose the preferred method, this variable should
 be provided through a persistent preference (such as a cookie).</li>
<li>Load the actual notifications. Regardless of the method, a 
notification always requires a text message to be specified. The reason 
is that a chosen non-text method (such as Flash) is not supported, it 
can fall back to a text based alternative.</li>
<li>For Flash Notifications, create a new sound object and add it to the
 notification created in the previous step. You don’t have to create a 
new sound object for every notification. You can also reuse the same 
sound in a unique way by changing its parameters.</li>
<li>Whenever an event occurs that should notify the user, fire the notification. The notifier will handle which method to use.:</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic code sample below shows a basic version of the function calls required to set up a notification involving Flash sound:</p>
<pre lang="javascript">//1. <span><span>create</span> notifier object. The <span>'method'</span> parameter should be retrieved <span>from</span> a <span>user</span> preference
tpgNotifier = new TPG.Notifier(method, Params);</span>
//2. Add a new notification, specifying its text message and ID which we will use for referencing
tpgNotifier.addNotification("30 characters left", "alert1");
//3. <span><span>create</span> a new sound object, <span>and</span> <span>add</span> the resulting ID <span>to</span> the notifier we created <span>in</span> step <span>2</span>
tpgNotifier.setNotificationSound(<span>"alert1"</span>, tpgNotifier.createSound(<span>"myFile.mp3"</span>));</span>
//4. On appropriate event, fire the notification
tpgNotifier.notify("alert1");</pre>
<h3>Browser Support</h3>
<p>This method has currently been tested on Internet Explorer 6 and up, 
Opera 9, Firefox 2 and Safari for Windows. Safari seems to have some 
issues when running the notifier from a local web page. As mentioned 
above this is still a work in progress.</p>
