						<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2014/03/17/the-extensible-web-summit/">Extensible Web Summit</a> happened in Berlin yesterday. This prompted written words from some big thinkers and doers. Jeremy Keith wrote a piece on <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/7431">Web Components</a> followed up by a <a href="https://infrequently.org/2014/09/uncomfortably-excited/">uncomfortably excited</a> response from Alex Russell.<span id="more-2994"></span></p>
<h2>On Piffle and Tosh and feasting upon Fetid code</h2>
<p>While <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/?s=web+components">I am as excited</a>
 as the next nerd by the potential of web components. Their development 
and marketing appear to follow the same depressing pattern of <em>ship first, oh yeah we better tack on some ARIA to cover up the cracks</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://infrequently.org/2014/09/uncomfortably-excited/">Alex stated yesterday</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jeremy’s argument, if I can paraphrase, is that people will build Web Components and this might be bad [for accessibility].<br>
…<br>
Piffle and tosh.</p></blockquote>
<p>I cannot but agree with Alex <em>piffle</em> wise. Jeremy’s argument 
does not go far enough.&nbsp; Web components are being built in the same
 development culture that web stuff is usually built in, and <strong>this is <em>bad</em></strong> for accessibility. This is not to say that web components are by definition <em>bad. </em>It
 is the same story for any implementation of accessibility support on 
the web, in browsers and in UI libraries: it usually comes after, often <em>way after</em>
 a product has been shipped and distributed to millions upon millions of
 people and 100s of thousands of developers have gorged on and 
regurgitated the code in their own projects.</p>
<h3>Examples?</h3>
<p>Some tweets I wrote in June (in usual diplomatic style) upon initial release of <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html#paper-button">Polymer Paper web components</a>
 which may well be fantastic examples of what can be achieved with this 
new technology, but were sadly lacking in even the most basic 
accessibility considerations (this situation has improved but they are 
still riddled with issues):</p>

<p>Alex stated yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Luckily we’ve been thinking very hard about this at 
Google and have invested heavily in Polymer and high-quality Material 
Design components that are, as I write this, undergoing review and 
enhancement for accessibility.<br>
…<br>
The economics of the new situation that Web Components introduce are 
(intentionally) tilted in a direction that provides ability for cream to
 rise to the top — and for the community to quickly judge if it smell 
off and do something about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Alex stated “Google … have invested heavily in Polymer” and also 
invest in accessibility (see references). What I can’t comprehend is why
 that investment of <em><strong>big</strong></em> smarts and <em><strong>big</strong></em>
 bucks by Google did not include the integration of accessibility and 
usability into the core development cycle? Why is it considered the 
community’s job to polish the turds?</p>
