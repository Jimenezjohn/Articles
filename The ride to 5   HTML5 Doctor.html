<h2>Forwards</h2>
<p>In recent weeks I contacted around 40 people, a cross section of those who have <em>banged away</em> at, or <em>banged on</em> about, HTML5. I asked them for their perspectives on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/">HTML5</a> becoming a W3C Recommendation. Below are the words of the 28 people who responded, <em>pretty much</em> in the order they hit my inbox:</p>
<h2>HTML5 is a W3C Recommendation, what do you think?</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>HTML began 25 years ago to provide content and links, the initial 
flesh and bones of the web. HTML5 is still the basis of a web of links 
and content, but it is now also the user interface part of an entire 
computing platorm. Now every web page can be programmed like a computer.
 That is a huge change, and we can only imagine what will be deployed in
 the future on top of the Open Web Platform.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I showed up at the W3C in 2007 to do three things: chew bubblegum, 
help get a new HTML spec to Recommendation, and kick ass. We’re now near
 the end of 2014, HTML5 has finally reached Rec, and I’m all out of 
bubblegum.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>The publication of the spec reflects a formidable success at finally 
gaining consensus. This is always difficult, but made more so in a group
 that could not move forward and at one point due to to infighting and 
the inability to do exactly what Tim Berners-Lee suggested we do in his 
remarks at yesterday’s W3C 20th Anniversary: “Sacrifice your own way of 
thinking.” So we’ve made big progress on that front. Insofar as the spec
 itself – as with all specifications – some good, some bad, some 
intolerable, some ridiculous. In the end it doesn’t matter, really, 
because it is not always what is specified that is pragmatic. That which
 is implemented and understood first become the languages, tools and 
techniques we actually put to use.</p>
<p>Again, my most sincere thanks for including me – each step forward in
 my work is a step forward in my enjoyment of life no matter my personal
 circumstance.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>The path to HTML5 has been more than a little rocky, and if the road 
to get to this point isn’t littered with dead bodies, there are some 
walking wounded among the specification participants.</p>
<p>But none of the interesting times spent working on this spec matters 
once HTML5 is officially done, and launched. All that matters is we have
 something we can all live with, being implemented in all our favorite 
tools, and providing us so much more than what we had before the effort 
started. That’s the win, the gold star, and the only reward so many hard
 working people will get for their effort with this spec: the web is a 
better, richer place.</p>
<p>So thank you hard working people, in the W3C and out. Thank you for not giving up, and seeing it to the end.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>All systems that are going to improve must “breathe”; they must 
undergo periods of expansion and consolidation. HTML5 represents 
important consolidation for the web platform and I’m glad that the W3C 
is putting a bow on it and getting broad agreement about what it “is”.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say we’re done; the reason I’ve worked on Web 
Components in the recent past is to help ensure that the next breath 
won’t need to be so deep or long. The driver of nearly all progress is 
iterative improvement. That HTML5’s parsing includes support for 
custom-element definitions helps ensure that we can democratize the 
evolution of our shared platform so that when we get around to it, HTML6
 can be informed by a vibrant community of extensions that pave a path 
for new semantics without fighting the language in the interim.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Finally a stable HTML5 specification that authors can develop 
against, knowing it will not change from one day to the next. And a lot 
sooner than the 2022 date that was previously mentioned.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>There are some really good things in HTML5. The re-think of how the 
spec works, as a way to take more or less anything that claims to be 
HTML and produce a DOM is a big step forward. And of course it is 
aligned with reality, and browsers have worked much harder to align with
 it than they ever did with HTML4 or 3.2, which makes everyone a winner.</p>
<p>There are things that are not that great. Writing a huge pile of 
algorithms makes the document very hard to read, and it is *very* big, 
which in itself is a drawback. Similarly, there are some steps forward 
for accessibility, and the inclusion of SVG and MathML is a step forward
 accessibility that should bring other advantages, although there are 
some problems in the real world that make this less valuable than one 
could hope.</p>
<p>But the disadvantages are minor compared with the advantage of having
 a modern spec that is pretty close to what browsers, web pages, and 
other tools actually work with. It’s high time to publish what is there,
 although it is important to keep working – the web is a living 
platform, and while different bits move at very different speeds we have
 been a bit slow in offering a stable target since XHTML 1.0 was 
published as the last significant revision of HTML.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with Meteor, recently; a javascript 
application framework. It returned a curious error just yesterday, when I
 started the application after editing the master HTML file: ‘Can’t set 
DOCTYPE here. (Meteor sets for you)’. Five, maybe four years ago this 
would have been considered highly dictatorial – irresponsible even.</p>
<p>The fact is, HTML5 is now the de facto language of the web. We know 
that already, so arguably a ‘recommendation’ from on high feels somewhat
 irrelevant. I see it like this: Together we – the implementers and 
authors – have embraced and advanced HTML5. We are the tide and the 
recommendation is the high water mark. It’s nice to see how far we’ve 
come.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Developing standards is not unlike developing software: you can’t 
just continue to develop new features – you have to stop from time to 
time, assess the features that you have, remove those that aren’t 
working, fix those that have bugs, and release a new version. HTML is 
such a beast and while it is important to continue its development, it’s
 also good to have a fixed feature set that people can reference and 
rely on. So: congratulations to the W3C for getting HTML5 to 
Recommendation status.</p>
<p>But what does it mean? HTML5 is the basis for a new stable and fully 
interoperable Web. It lists a feature set that Web developers should be 
able to rely on in all browsers. Thus, HTML5 is a Recommendation to 
browser developers to make that interoperability uniform. Find those 
features that your browser isn’t supporting yet in the list of HTML5 
features and implement them (well, yeah: by also looking at the version 
of that feature in the WHATWG spec, where bugs are fixed and features 
continue to evolve).</p>
<p>This means, to everyone else: HTML5 is a Recommendation to develop 
more benchmarks that test the interoperability of the features. There 
are places like <a href="http://html5test.com/" target="_blank">http://html5test.com/</a> , <a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">http://caniuse.com/</a> , or the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/test-results/html/details.html">W3C’s own test </a><a href="http://w3c.github.io/test-results/html/details.html">suite</a>, already, but HTML5 is big, so find your favorite features and help make the Recommendation become a real standard.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>It’s marvellous that HTML5 has reached this point of maturity, and 
that accessibility has truly emerged as a core design principle. The 
inclusion of ARIA puts critical semantic information right where 
developers need it – at the heart of the HTML specification. Coupled 
with features that were introduced in HTML5 (like native controls and 
new structural elements), we’re now in a position to design and build 
innovative interfaces that are usable by everyone.</p>
<p>This milestone is a time to look to the future as much as to past 
accomplishments though. As HTML development continues, we need to 
achieve and maintain a faster and more flexible way of working, without 
sacrificing the inherent stability and resilience of this open W3C 
standard.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>People hardly remember in what limbo state was (X)HTML in 2007. At 
the time, I was part of W3C staff. We were struggling and discussing 
about the best outcome for the future of HTML. WhatWG had started since 
2004 to rewrite the lingua franca MarkUp language with a much more 
implementers oriented specification. Finally W3C rebooted the HTML WG on
 March 2007.</p>
<p>To see HTML5 being finally released is a huge step for all people of 
good will participating into this effort. Imagine that. For the first 
time, we defined a precise algorithm for parsing HTML as it is written 
on the Web. It means less ambiguity. We got an enriched semantics for 
authors with a lot better support by browsers than in the past. It means
 better accessibility. And so many other things.</p>
<p>There will be more struggles in the future. How do we, the Web 
community altogether, decide to evolve the Web? But, we now have a solid
 foundation where we can build upon and explore new areas. This is 
HTML5. Let’s celebrate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>HTML 5.0 isn’t a destination, but rather a long-overdue step on a long journey.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I have mixed feelings about the process, but I’m delighted that HTML5
 will be “finished” in 2014. Sure beats 2022. As for the idea that there
 will be subsequent updates (HTML5.1, HTML5.2, etc.), well, of course 
there will be. Specifications make more sense to me than the idealistic 
but somewhat vague idea of HTML as a “living standard.” Living standards
 are nice, but it’s also nice to be able to say that Browser X fully 
supports HTML 5.0 (or HTML 5.1, and so on).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Prior to HTML5, HTML did little to ensure consistent implementation 
across browsers and accessibility features were added late in the cycle 
without a comprehensive look at accessibility and how accessibility 
could be added in a way that made it easier for the developer to produce
 custom accessible applications. The release of HTML5 to recommendation 
status by the W3C specifies how HTML must be implemented across browsers
 to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>HTML5 is also the first host language to give authors a comprehensive
 set of tools to produce accessible custom rich internet applications, 
through its integration of WAI-ARIA, and accessible rich media to 
support the blind and visually impaired. These changes leverage the 
browser to produce cross-platform accessible applications at a 
dramatically reduced cost over native platforms as the cost of mapping 
the accessibility information to platform accessibility API services 
layers is pushed off to the user agent.</p>
<p>In short, HTML5 has established the core plumbing needed for 
accessibility and browser consistency and the work here can now be 
carried over and built upon for electronic books, Scalable Vector 
Graphics, and CSS – the bar has been raised. With the core plumbing in 
place the greater areas of innovation will now be in accessible 
graphics, device independent interaction, enhance web application 
functionality, CSS driven content and navigation, and context aware 
application infrastructure development.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Finally! w00t!</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>On the one hand, it doesn’t really matter whether HTML5 is W3C 
recommendation or not. After all, what really matters to developers is 
what they can use in browsers today. So, from that perspective, the way 
the WHATWG views HTML as a “Living Standard” makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s awfully nice to have some stability in the 
ever-changing world of web standards and browsers. That’s where the W3C 
provides balance. They are the yin to the WHATWG’s yang.</p>
<p>HTML5 reaching recommendation status provides a welcome punctuation 
in the ongoing story of the most important format ever created.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Gosh! It’s not 2022, yet we’re getting HTML5 early! Of course, many 
web developers know that much of “HTML5” has been ready for a long time 
in browsers, but it’s important that IT Directors, compliance people and
 clients know that this is a *stable* standard that reflects what’s in 
browsers now. With an incredibly active community of developers, browser
 vendors and spec authors, this is a milestone but emphatically *not* 
the destination. Onwards, and vive le web!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Many people do not realize that agreement and adoption happens on a 
continuum: Early adopters pay a price to do it. As things settle down, 
waves of increasingly less knowledgeable or risk-averse adopters join 
in, and all the while we are honing the proposal, and implementations. 
Given this, for many of us, promotion of HTML 5 to REC will seem like a 
non-event – a kind of statement of the obvious. At some level, it is: A 
recommendation, at its best, is a statement of agreement about already 
at that point *is* standard, not what should be. The value in REC is 
setting of a goal more than the eventual arrival. It’s true that there 
is a long tail of developers who are unwilling (or even unable) adopt 
until something reaches this level of maturity officially, and for them,
 this move will be a very big deal indeed. For the rest of us, I’d 
suggest that this is the time to appreciate the many hurdles crossed and
 the long struggles to arrive to this point – step back, assess and 
examine the things that made it much harder and more frustrating than it
 should have been at times and the ways that we can improve it all 
dramatically by changing the model, involving developers, building up 
and letting us #extendthewebforward.

<blockquote>

<p>I am very pleased to see the World Wide Web Consortium release a new 
version of html in a specification that is not going to change 
overnight. Even if a frozen state implies imperfections, I don’t see 
that as a problem if errata are correctly and timely dealt with. That’s 
the mistake the W3C made years ago not maintaining HTML4 and I think 
they got the message. A frozen html5 was needed by some industries out 
there that just cannot cope with living standards. Some of our partners 
in Standardization, like IDPF or ISO, also need to refer to a given 
version of our specifications. The world of our users is very different 
from the world of our implementers and we neglected some of them. The 
W3C has implemented considerable changes to its process to achieve that 
html5 release. Some came easily, some were heavily discussed and 
triggered a lot of noise. After a start based on a rather heavy process,
 the HTML WG came back to more pragmatism. I see that as a mark of 
maturity. I now look forward to the modularization of html, the 
specification looking too heavy to me to remain as is in the future.

<blockquote>

<p>The relatively popular opposition between living standards and 
snapshots is a false dichotomy. More importantly, we don’t need to 
choose: as a community we have vast amounts of experience with a 
processes that marry continuous updates, testing, and periodic releases 
as that is a common and proven way of producing software.</p>
<p>Standards are similar to software in more ways than one, yet we have 
long been remiss in applying our knowledge of the latter to the former. 
This needs to change.</p>
<p>HTML5 exhibits many of the travails of large software projects. Is it
 perfect? No. Is it complete? Not in the least. But we’re now in a good 
place to move on to a new phase in which we push open standards towards a
 saner, happier open source-like model. I for one welcome this bright 
future.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Milestones are an important part of any journey, and this is a 
significant milestone. I’m glad to see us reach this one, and I’m 
looking forward to seeing what comes as we approach the next.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>It will be great to finally have a version of HTML that can be used 
as a standard to work from. Although some of us are lucky enough to work
 in an environment where we can happily use experimental and 
non-standard HTML features, there are others for whom standards are very
 important – perhaps even mandatory – and having one for HTML allows 
them to move up a step to something stable. This can only be a good 
thing.</p>
<p>In the beginning it was said that HTML5 would not be “ready” until 
2022, but here we are at the end of 2014 and we’re nearly there. A lot 
of hard work by a lot of different people – in the W3C, WHATWG, and 
outside – has gone into getting the specification this far, and long may
 it continue to evolve.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>HTML5 going to Rec is a significant milestone and something of 
significant value for society. It will be the first time we have an 
actual (royalty) free and open standard that describes how core parts of
 the Web Platform *actually work*. Despite the success of the Web, 
previous attempts to standardize HTML were not very successful, forcing 
browser vendors to reverse engineer each others browsers. This led to 
many years of stagnation in the platforms.</p>
<p>With HTML, we actually have a more realistic understanding of how the
 platform works. And with the IPR assurance that comes from HTML5 going 
to Rec, it means that everyone will be free to implement what is in the 
HTML5 specification without fear of legal repercussion from other W3C 
members who were part of the HTML WG. We are talking about big big big 
companies with large patent portfolios potentially worth millions, which
 they are essentially giving to the commons. Thanks, Apple, Google, 
Microsoft, IBM, etc.! you is good peoples.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>It is time for HTML5 to graduate. It seems to me that we’ve done a 
too good job hyping HTML5 whilst we created and implemented it in 
browsers and we moved fast and broke a lot of things. You’d be hard 
pushed to find “HTML5 solutions” out there using plain vanilla code and 
not rely on many abstractions, polyfills and libraries. Even worse, many
 tell you flat out to use a certain browser – a massive mistake we 
already made with IE6 in the past. In the enterprise world, none of 
these “fixes” are applicable without certification or auditing and even 
HTML5 wasn’t really an option until it is a recommendation.</p>
<p>It will be an interesting talk to convince people to upgrade all the 
old systems that rely on bespoke browser technology of 1999 and move 
towards a multi-browser world. Having a recommendation sanctified by the
 W3C is a great stake in the ground to work from.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I think the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/">W3C HTML5 Recommendation</a>
 is important in the sense that some very big companies have committed 
(or are about to commit) to exclude the important Web functionality 
described by the W3C HTML5 Recommendation (which is a modified snapshot 
of <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">WHATWG HTML</a>) from patent 
aggression. However, I think the W3C HTML5 Recommendation should not be 
oversold as being useful for purposes other than a reference point under
 the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. In particular, the “<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html">Plan 2014</a>”
 process arrangement that allowed HTML5 to proceed to Recommendation 
with relatively sparse test coverage means that it’s quite possible that
 there are areas of the specification that developers shouldn’t be 
relying on in case those areas of the specification turn out to be wrong
 due to inadequate test coverage.</p>
<p>In general, it’s a bad idea for both browser developers and Web 
developers to read old specification snapshots. Browser developers 
should generally read Editor’s Drafts instead of Recommendation 
snapshots and test suites should also track the most recent spec edits 
instead of reflecting snapshots whose bugs may already have been fixed 
in more recent edits. For Web developers it often makes sense to refer 
to Web developer-targeted documentation such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> or <a href="http://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> and, when those fail, also refer to Editor’s Drafts of the relevant specifications.</p>
<p>The cost of getting to this snapshot has been very high, 
unfortunately. It’s very sad that the HTML WG ended up driving away many
 of the people who had contributed to the HTML5 effort at the WHATWG and
 had come over to the HTML WG when the new HTML WG was established in 
2007 to bring the WHATWG’s work on HTML5 into the W3C. I hope the 
divergence between WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML won’t be permanent.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>One of the most pleasing aspects of the W3C’s work on HTML 5 has been
 the renewed commitment to testing, through initiatives such as <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">Test the Web Forward</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests#description">web-platform-tests</a>
 open source project. Implementation differences have long been a source
 of frustration for&nbsp; web developers, and the creation of 
cross-browser testsuites for the web platform is the best way to 
eliminate them in the future.</p>
<p>Just because HTML 5 has now reached Recommendation status, this 
testing work does not stop. Although HTML now has a more substantial 
testsuite than at any time in the past, we know that there are large 
areas that still have poor test coverage. Rectifying this is an ongoing 
project, and one where all web developers can make an invaluable 
contribution by submitting tests to web-platform-tests whenever they 
encounter incompatibilities between different browsers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>HTML5 is an important step forward for browser interoperability. When
 HTML 4.01 was published back in 1999, it said “Since user agents may 
vary in how they handle error conditions, authors and users must not 
rely on specific error recovery behavior.” This meant that the behaviour
 of malformed HTML was undefined despite a huge percentage of pages 
being malformed (some deliberately for better performance in some 
browsers). Back them, few would have believed that it was possible to 
write down a common algorithm for parsing HTML and then get all the 
popular browser engines to adopt and implement it. But HTML5 did that. 
And it did so much more. The HTML5 Recommendation brought a level of 
preciseness to the core pieces of the web that we didn’t have before.</p>
<p>Is HTML5 finished? Is it perfect? No, it’s a software project and it 
is a work in progress as is the whole web. The web keeps growing, keeps 
adding new capabilities, and keeps getting better. But shipping is a 
feature and the web community has spent the last couple of years 
stabilising and scoping the HTML5 specification. This is an important 
stabilisation milestone on the way to an even better future.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>The HTML5 parsing steps and I become acquainted long before I joined 
the editor team; I ran the spec algorithm on a particular input that was
 exploiting a defect in IE to confirm both that 1) if IE had only 
implemented the spec this wouldn’t be a problem and that 2) the HTML5 
spec was going to take more than a mild investment to fully understand. 
Boy, was that an understatement.</p>
<p>HTML5 changed a lot of things. It redefined the expectations of what 
degree of detail is necessary to achieve broad interop. It brought 
together and standardized diverse new capabilities like media and 
canvas. It demystified name lookup on the window. It even provided all 
those who had the pleasure of working with it a great deal of 
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;. Literally.</p>
<p>Getting this spec to Rec is a major accomplishment for so many 
people. While HTML’s journey will surely continue on, it’s great to 
pause and appreciate this significant milestone. I’ve had a wonderful 
time getting to know the many amazing, talented, and persistent people 
behind the scenes making it all happen. Thanks and congratulations!</p></blockquote>

<p>To keep the web truly open we need to protect our multi-browser
