						<p>The recent formalisation of the ‘HTML split’ between the W3C 
and the WHATWG, is not news to those working in either group. Work 
continues pretty much as it has, prior to <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2012Jul/0119.html">Hixie’s communication</a> to the WHATWG.</p>

<h2>HTML Implementation in Browsers</h2>
<p>The reality is that browser implementation information of HTML will 
be similar if not the same up until the point where HTML5 is finalised 
at the W3C. There may be some minor differences due to the W3C spec not 
keeping up with changes to the WHATWG spec or points where not all 
browser vendors have agreed on the implementation details of a 
particluar feature. In the latter case it may be that the WHATWG spec or
 the W3C spec contains implementation information relevant to some but 
not all current implementations or a proposed implementation that has 
not actually been implemented by anybody.</p>
<p>It will be the case that as finalisation of HTML5 occurs at the W3C, 
the browser implementation information in it will become progressively 
out of date as new features are specced in the WHATWG HTML, 
implementation bugs arise and are fixed. Concurrently with the 
finalisation of HTML5 it is envisaged that work on <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/next">HTML.next</a>
 will commence at the W3C, taking HTML5 as its basis.&nbsp; It will 
likely be the case that HTML.next will mostly track the WHATWG spec on 
implementation details where browser vendors have indicated they intend 
to implement the WHATWG spec as written. This is not always the case now
 and will not be so in the future, for example some of the new additions
 to <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html">canvas</a>
 contained in the WHATWG spec have not been agreed upon by browser 
vendors and further work is taking place between Apple and Microsoft and
 other stakeholders to agree upon the details, <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/201">this work</a>
 is occurring in the W3C HTML WG. If it is the case that the Canvas 2d 
context spec contains agreed upon implementation details that the WHATWG
 spec does not, then what should occur is the WHATWG spec changes to 
reflect such consensus. So let us not be fooled into thinking that the 
current and future specification of HTML is a one way street always 
leading from the WHATWG to the the W3C. So it may be that at moments in 
time implementation details in the current W3C HTML (whether that be 
HTML5 or HTML X) and WHATWG HTML&nbsp; diverge, but it will not be a 
permanent divergence unless either spec diverges from reality.</p>
<p>It is not the case that WHATWG spec always contains a realistic 
representation of what is implemented in browsers, it contains defined 
features that are not yet implemented by any browser even though they 
have been in the spec (and HTML5) for years. And it omits features 
implemented in browsers. The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html">command element</a> has been specced for years When Mozilla decided to implement the HTML5 <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-menu-element.html#context-menus">context menu</a> instead decided to use the unspecified (in HTML) &lt;menuItem&gt; element rather than implement the command element.</p>
<h2>HTML Accessibility Implementation in Browsers</h2>
<p>While the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2012Jul/0119.html">WHATWG claims</a>
 its goal is to provide a canonical description of HTML and related 
technologies,&nbsp; it only contains a minimal description of how 
browsers should implement HTML support for assistive technology. The 
WHATWG have never shown any interest to my knowledge (note: <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20120723#l-664">anne van kesteren claims this is FUD</a>,
 but have not seen anything from the WHATWG leadership to suggest 
otherwise and Hixie stated the HTML to accessibility API document <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Objections_against_CP_for_ISSUE-129&amp;diff=6214&amp;oldid=6213">was unecessary</a>) in specifying the level of detail required for the interoperable implementation of accessible HTML. <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-api-map/raw-file/tip/Overview.html">This work</a>
 is being carried out at the in the W3C HTML WG as part of the ongoing 
HTML standardization effort. WHATWG leader Ian Hickson decided to fork 
HTML rather than include a link to it in the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5?">WHATWG HTML</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5?"><p>The W3C HTML specification includes a link to an incomplete    document that contradicts this specification because of <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Feb/0407.html">a    working group decision from February 2011</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Author conformance requirements and advice</h2>
<p>Much of the authoring conformance requirements and advice impacts the
 accessibility of the authored content. This is where things get less 
predictable. While requirements and advice in regards to HTML feature 
implementation in browsers is in essence dictated by what browsers will 
implement, how such features are to be used is not and consequently the 
differing HTML development processes between the W3C and the WHATWG have
 had most effect and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>To get author conformance requirements and advice on the how to use 
HTML into the WHATWG spec, or get it changed, you must convince Ian 
Hickson (Hixie). If Hixie does not agree with you it doesn’t go in or it
 doesn’t change. The W3C HTML working group does not work this way. You 
can present your arguments, research and data to the working group and 
whether information is added to or changed in W3C HTML is decided by the
 working group using a consensus process. And yes this can take longer 
than a simple <em>Yay or Nay</em> from Hixie, but I&nbsp; think the extra time is worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Some examples</h3>
<p>I have long argued that due to the almost complete lack of keyboard 
access to the the title attribute in browsers, the HTML specification 
should not include conformance requirements and&nbsp; authoring advice 
for the use of the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/global-attributes.html#the-title-attribute">title attribute</a> that will result in inaccessible content. I provided information on this to the HTML WG and Hixie, (then) editor of HTML5:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/notitle_annotations">Advice in spec about annotations promotes inaccessible content</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/notitlev2">Do
 not consider the title attribute as a  possible conforming source for 
caption information for an image that  lacks a text alternative</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/notitle_captions">Replace poor coding example for figure containing multiple images</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these proposals were considered and accepted by the HTML WG 
and the changes were made to HTML5 to reflect this. While at the WHATWG,
 Hixie, making no argument either way simply <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5?">rejected the changes</a>, resulting in further forking of HTML:</p>
<blockquote><p>The W3C HTML specification omits a number of suggestions    regarding using the <code title="attr-title"><a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-title-attribute">title</a></code> attribute, and makes using the <code title="attr-title"><a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-title-attribute">title</a></code>
 attribute for captions    non-conforming in certain specific cases, 
because of a number of    working group chair decisions from March 2012:
    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Mar/0555.html">first</a>,    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Mar/0731.html">second</a>,    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Mar/0785.html">third</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I would appreciate ANYONE&nbsp; explaining how the splintering of
 authoring conformance requirements and advice being good for anyone? Is
 it good for users? developers? If not then who?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/22/3175248/html5-fork-w3c-whatwg">recently been reported</a>
 as a split has in effect been happening for some time. If all you care 
about is how browsers implement or are expected to implement some 
aspects of HTML then you have little to worry about, both W3C HTML and 
WHATWG HTML will include pretty much the same information over time. The
 locus of the HTML accessibility work will continue to be at the W3C and
 in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/html-task-force">HTML WG</a>, 
the specification of how browsers implement HTML to support 
accesssibility, will continue in the W3C HTML working group. The 
development of author conformance requirements and advice based on real 
world implementations and direct participation from users will continue 
in the W3C HTML WG.</p>
<h3>Is this HTML5?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5?">HTML living standard still claims to be HTML5</a>, while the HTML living standard <a href="http://developers.whatwg.org/">‘developer edition’</a> still calls itself “HTML5 A technical specification for Web developers”, so if you are interested in <em>how to</em>
 use HTML to provide a better, more accessible user experience, then 
increasingly you will be in a quandary as to which set of rules to 
follow and which set of rules you are <em>actually</em> following. I think you know <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html">which one I would suggest</a>…</p>
