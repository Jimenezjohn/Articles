						<p>Anybody with any real  world accessibility experience knows that using CSS <code>:focus {outline:none}</code> as recommended in the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">WHATWG HTML living standard</a> is <strong>not a solution</strong> to any problem, it only replaces one accessibility issue with another. This why I <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/outlinenone">worked hard</a> to get the advice still present in the ‘living standard’ removed from the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">W3C HTML5 specification</a>.</p>

<h2>killing CSS outlines for mouse users only</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/#!/stevefaulkner/status/194707575550390272"><p><strong>Note:</strong> I am not advocating removal of CSS outlines, but if you must, do it in a way that does not screw keyboard users</p></blockquote>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p><img src="how%20to%20remove%20CSS%20outlines%20in%20an%20accessible%20manner_files/outline.png" alt="'test link' with dotted oultine displayed" width="104" height="41"><br>
Some developers/designers/clients do not like the default focus 
rectangle that is displayed when a user clicks on an interactive element
 such as a link. Methods to remove it such as <code>onfocus="blur()"</code> result in keyboard users being unable to interact with the link or control. While use of CSS <code>outline:none</code>
 results in the link or control being focusable but with no visible 
indication of focus for keyboard users. Neither method provides an 
accessible user interface.</p>
<h3>An accessible solution?</h3>
<p><img src="how%20to%20remove%20CSS%20outlines%20in%20an%20accessible%20manner_files/nooutline.png" alt="'test link' without a dotted outline" width="112" height="40"></p>
<p>Starting with the page having no CSS outline:none rules applied. Apply CSS outline:none rules using JavaScript <strong>ONLY IF</strong> mouse user depressesing the mouse button is detected. Remove the rules again <strong>IF </strong>keyboard interaction is detected.</p>
<h4><strong>Example code:</strong></h4>
<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
<strong>&lt;style id="poot"&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</strong><br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body <strong>onmousedown="document.getElementById('poot').innerHTML='a{outline:none}';" onkeydown="document.getElementById('poot').innerHTML=''"</strong>&gt;<br>
&lt;a href="#"&gt;test link&lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>
<h4><strong>Notes:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li> A <a href="http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/outline.html">test page</a> is available</li>
<li>Example only suppresses outline on links for mouse users.</li>
<li>Tested with Firefox, IE, Chrome, Opera and Safari on Windows.</li>
<li>Use of inline event handlers is for demonstration purposes only.</li>
<li>If you create a more sophisticated script based on this idea please share
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/arglazer">Aireh Glazer</a> has created a <a href="https://gist.github.com/2470777"><span id="description">Cross-Lib accessible outline removal</span></a> script</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/lindsayevans/">Lindsay Evans</a> has created <a href="https://github.com/lindsayevans/outline.js">outline.js</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you encounter any issues provide feedback</li>
<li>how it works with touch based interfaces has not been investigated much:
<ul>
<li>using Opera mini and Safari on iPad, the links still show their 
default activation indicator and the same using webkit on android 
(feedback from <a href="https://twitter.com/#sideshowbarker">@sideshowbarker</a>), which is the best outcome for usability/accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The back story</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">W3C HTML5 specification</a> now states:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><var>element</var> . <code title="dom-blur"><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dom-blur">blur</a></code>()</dt>
<dd>Unfocuses the element. Use of this method is discouraged. Focus     another element instead.&nbsp;
<p>Do not use this method to hide the focus ring. Do not use any     
other method that hides the focus ring from keyboard users,in     
particluar do not use a CSS rule to override the ‘outline’ property. 
Removal of the focus ring leads to serious accessibility issues for 
users who navigate and interact with interactive content using the 
keyboard.</p>

<h3>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">WHATWG Living Standard</a> makes claims it provides advice on how to remove focus outlines in an ‘accessible manner’:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The W3C HTML specification omits some advice about how to<strong> remove focus outlines in an accessible manner</strong>
 (instead only urging     authors not to remove them without giving an  
alternative to address     the “they’re ugly” use case), because of a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Mar/0786.html">working     group chair decision from March 2012</a>.</p>

<h3>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">WHATWG HTML living standard</a> continues to state:</h3>
<blockquote cite="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">
<p><code>element . blur()</code>Unfocuses the element. Use of this method is discouraged. Focus another element instead.</p>
<p>Do not use this method to hide the focus ring if you find the  focus 
ring unsightly. Instead, use a CSS rule to override the ‘outline’  
property. (Be aware, however, that this makes the page significantly

use focus outlines to help them navigate the page.)</p>
<p>For example, to hide the outline from links, you could use:</p>
<p><code>:link:focus, :visited:focus { outline: none; }</code></p>

<h3>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#element-level-focus-apis">WHATWG HTML living standard</a> does not contain advice on how to remove focus outlines in an ‘accessible manner’</h3>
<p>By its own admission the ‘living standard’ states the recommended alternative to using <code>.blur()</code> is bad for accessibility:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This warning also contains a factual innacuracy as use of outline:none makes the page <strong>significantly less accessible to any keyboard only user</strong>,
  not only those with reduced vision. Not providing a visible indication
  of focus makes the user interface unusable for keyboard only users in 
any  circumstance where the page has more than a few focusable elements.</p>
